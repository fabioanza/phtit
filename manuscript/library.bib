abstract = {Physical and numerical experiments show that deterministic noise, or chaos, is ubiquitous. While a good understanding of the onset of chaos has been achieved, using as a mathematical tool the geometric theory of differentiable dynamical systems, moderately excited chaotic systems require new tools, which are provided by the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. This theory has reached a stage where fruitful contact and exchange with physical experiments has become widespread. The present review is an account of the main mathematical ideas and their concrete implementation in analyzing experiments. The main subjects are the theory of dimensions (number of excited degrees of freedom), entropy (production of information), and characteristic exponents (describing sensitivity to initial conditions). The relations between these quantities, as well as their experimental determination, are discussed. The systematic investigation of these quantities provides us for the first time with a reasonable understanding of dynamical systems, excited well beyond the quasiperiodic regimes. This is another step towards understanding highly turbulent fluids.},

abstract = {All natural things process and transform information. They receive environmental information as input, and transform it into appropriate output responses. Much of science is dedicated to building models of such systems—algorithmic abstractions of their input–output behavior that allow us to simulate how such systems can behave in the future, conditioned on what has transpired in the past. Here, we show that classical models cannot avoid inefficiency—storing past information that is unnecessary for correct future simulation. We construct quantum models that mitigate this waste, whenever it is physically possible to do so. This suggests that the complexity of general input–output processes depends fundamentally on what sort of information theory we use to describe them. npj Quantum Information (2017) 3:6 ; doi:10.1038/s41534-016-0001-3 INTRODUCTION Every experiment involves applying actions to some system, and recording corresponding output responses. Both inputs and outputs are recorded as classical bits of information, and the system's operational behavior can always be regarded as an input–output process that transforms inputs to outputs. Quanti-tative science aims to capture such behavior within mathematical models—algorithmic abstractions that can simulate future beha-vior based on past observations. There is keen interest in finding the simplest models—models that replicate a system's future behavior while storing the least past information. 1, 2 The motivations are twofold. Firstly, from the rationale of Occam's razor, we should posit no more causes of natural things than are necessary to explain their appearances. Every piece of past information a model requires represents a potential cause of future events, and thus simpler models better isolate the true indicators of future behavior. The second is practical. As we wish to simulate and engineer systems of increasing complexity, there is always need to find methods that utilize more modest memory requirements. This motivated systematic methods for constructing such models. The state of the art are $\epsilon$-transducers, models of input–output processes that are provably optimal—no other means of modeling a given input–output process can use less past information. 3 The amount of past information such a transducer requires thus presents a natural measure of the process's intrinsic complexity. This heralded new ways to understand structure in diverse systems, ranging from evolutionary dynamics to action-perception cycles. 4–7 Yet $\epsilon$-transducers are classical, their optim-ality only proven among classical models. Recent research indicates that quantum models can more simply simulate stochastic processes that evolve independently of input. 8–10 Can quantum theory also surpass classical limits in modeling general processes that behave differently on different input? Here, we present systematic methods to construct quantum transducers—quantum models that can be simpler than their optimal classical counterparts. The resulting constructions exhibit significant generality: they improve upon optimal classical models whenever it is physically possible to do so. Our work indicates that classical models waste information unavoidably and this waste can be mitigated via quantum processing.},

abstract = {How do closed quantum many-body systems driven out of equilibrium eventually achieve equilibration? And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these—and related— questions has accelerated in recent years—a trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation. I t was established early on that equilibrium states corresponding to a known temperature can be effectively captured using the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Intuitively less clear, however, is precisely how these states can be reached through local dynamics that follows microscopic laws. This insufficiency immediately gives rise to a certain tension between a microscopic description, and one that makes use of the familiar ensembles of statistical mechanics. It also leads to the question of how one might grasp the actual dynamics of quantum phase transitions. These questions were posed many decades ago, but most have remained largely unresolved. It was only relatively recently that they again became a focus of attention—a development driven by the availability of experiments providing the necessary controlled conditions, but also by progress in theoretical physics.

The discrete unit (quantum) of electrical conductance G has been observed in many experiments dating back to 1988 ( 1 , 2 ), but the quantum of thermal conductance G 0,Th has been much more challenging to probe. Unlike tiny electrical currents, it is much harder to measure minute heat currents in a reproducible manner. On page 1192 of this issue, Cui et al. ( 3 ) conquer this challenge by developing an experimental platform for studying quantum thermal transport at the atomic limit. Their work reveals that thermal conductance can be quantized even at room temperature, as well as the fundamental relation between the thermal and electrical conductances.

The past decade has seen a series of remarkable experimental developments in ultracold Fermi gases that have realized the BCS-BEC crossover in the laboratory, bringing with it fresh new insights into the very strongly interacting unitary regime in the middle of this crossover. In this review, we start with a pedagog-ical introduction to the crossover and then focus on recent progress in the strongly interacting regime. Although our focus is on new theoret-ical developments, we also describe three key experiments that probe the thermodynamics, transport, and spectroscopy of the unitary Fermi gas. We discuss connections between the unitary regime and other areas of physics—quark-gluon plasmas, gauge-gravity duality, and high-temperature superconductivity—and conclude with open questions about strongly interacting Fermi gases.},

Despite the fact that the theory is more than 100 years old, we are still discussing its foundations and its regime of applicability. A point of crucial importance is the definition of the notion of thermal equilibrium, which is given as the state that maximises the von Neumann entropy. Here we argue that it is necessary to propose a new way of describing thermal equilibrium, focused on observables rather than on the full state of the quantum system. We characterise the notion of thermal equilibrium, for a given observable, via the maximisation of its Shannon entropy and highlight the thermal properties that such a principle heralds. The relation with Gibbs ensembles is brought to light. Furthermore, we apply such a notion of equilibrium to a closed quantum systems and prove that there is always a class of observables which exhibits thermal equilibrium properties and we give a recipe to explicitly construct them. Eventually, we bring to light an intimate connection of such a principle with the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis.},

abstract = {We study numerically the thermalization and temporal evolution of a two-site subsystem of a fermionic Hubbard model prepared far from equilibrium at a definite energy. Even for very small systems near quantum degeneracy, the subsystem can reach a steady state resembling equilibrium. This occurs for a nonperturbative coupling between the subsystem and the rest of the lattice where relaxation to equilibrium is Gaussian in time, in sharp contrast to perturbative results. We find similar results for random couplings, suggesting such behavior is generic for small systems. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.260402 PACS numbers: 05.30.Ch, 03.65.{\`{A}}w Understanding the origin of statistical mechanics from a purely quantum-mechanical description is an interesting area of active research [1–9]. Of particular interest is the situation of an isolated quantum system partitioned into a subsystem and a bath. We ask the question: how do ob-servables on the subsystem thermalize when the total sys-tem is in a pure state? Seminal works [1,2] have demonstrated the concept of ''canonical typicality'' that most random pure states of well-defined energy for the total system lead to thermalized reduced density matrices (RDMs) for the small subsystem. Numerical works have demonstrated thermalization in spin or boson systems for various observables of the subsystem [3–5] (and of the entire closed system [6,10]). Recent theoretical work [11] has investigated whether thermalization of small subsys-tems, initially far from equilibrium, is generic. In this Letter, we investigate the temporal relaxation towards a steady state, focusing on the regime where the steady state appears thermalized. We consider a small Hubbard ring of fermions away from half-filling, with two adjacent sites as a subsystem and the other sites as a bath. We prepare the system in a product state of subsystem and bath pure states in a narrow energy window. Even for such a small system, we find a steady-state RDM close to a thermal state, down to quantum degenerate temperatures. Moreover, we find that the RDM diagonal elements ap-proach a steady state as an exponential decay for weak subsystem-bath coupling. This becomes a Gaussian decay at a nonperturbative coupling, with a decay rate that de-parts significantly from the Fermi golden rule. We note that this is distinct from the Gaussian behavior in driven sys-tems that remain out of equilibrium [12], and in decoher-ence dynamics [13] of off-diagonal RDM elements in systems that cannot thermalize. The Model.—Taking motivation from cold atoms in optical lattices [14,15] where local addressing is possible, we study a local cluster in a generic (nonintegrable) inter-acting system with a quasicontinuous spectrum. We will examine how a local subsystem (S) thermalizes with the rest of the system as a bath (B) via unitary evolution of the whole system under the Hamiltonian H ¼ H S þ H B þ V where H S (H B), with eigenstates jsi S (jbi B) of energy " s (b), acts solely on the subsystem (bath). V is the cou-pling between the subsystem and the bath. For ¼ 0, the eigenstates are products of subsystem and bath eigenstates, denoted jsbi, with energies E sb ¼ " s þ b . The homoge-neous case corresponds to ¼ 1. Specifically, we choose a two-site subsystem in an L-site Hubbard ring of fermions:},

Rev. E 75 050102 (Preprint cond-mat/0703213)) the quantum version of the Crooks fluctuation theorem is shown to emerge almost immediately by the mere application of an inverse Fourier transformation. PACS numbers: 05.40.−a, 87.16.−b, 87.19.Nn Work and fluctuation theorems have ignited much excitement during the recent decade [1–4]. These theorems have prompted further theoretical investigations [5–8] as well as experimental research [9]. We here consider a quantum system staying in weak thermal contact with a heat bath at the inverse temperature $\beta$ until a time t 0 . At time t 0 the contact to the heat bath is then either kept at this weak level, or may even be switched off altogether. A classical time-dependent force solely acts on the system according to a prescribed protocol until time t f . A protocol defines a family of Hamiltonians {\{}H (t){\}} t f ,t 0 which govern the time evolution of the system during the indicated interval of time [t 0 , t f ] in the presence of the external force. The weak action of the heat bath on the system can be neglected for any protocol of finite duration t f − t 0 [10]. The work performed by the force on the system is a random quantity because of the quantum nature of the considered system and because the system is prepared in the thermal equilibrium state $\rho$(t 0) = Z −1 (t 0) exp{\{}−$\beta$H (t 0){\}} (1)},

As an application, we discuss a class of states whose squares linearly depend on the states themselves, and give the corresponding analytical expressions of SLD and QFI.

abstract = {The thermodynamics of quantum coherence has attracted growing attention recently, where the thermodynamic advantage of quantum superposition is characterized in terms of quantum thermodynamics. We investigate the thermodynamic effects of quantum coherent driving in the context of the fluctuation theorem. We adopt a quantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback control. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process plays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum measurement and postselection must be considered in the backward process, in sharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with quantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space of quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong irreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute irreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down. In the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute irreversibility, because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region compatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems, absolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective measurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically forbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of absolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum coherent driving. Absolute irreversibility is shown to emerge in the absence of coherent driving after the measurement, especially in systems under time-delayed feedback control. We show that absolute irreversibility is mitigated by increasing the duration of quantum coherent driving or decreasing the delay time of feedback control.},

How these wave phenomena relate to those in crystalline (periodic ordered) materials---arguably the better understood setting---has been a mystery ever since Anderson discovered disorder-induced localization. Nonetheless, together these revolutionized materials science and technology and led to new physics far beyond the solid state. We introduce a broad family of structurally complex materials---chaotic crystals---that interpolate between these organizational extremes---systematically spanning periodic structures and random disorder. Within the family one can tune the degree of disorder to sweep through an intermediate structurally disordered region between two periodic lattices. This reveals new transport and localization phenomena reflected in a rich array of energy-dependent localization degree and density of states. In particular, strong localization is observed even with a very low degree of disorder. Moreover, markedly enhanced localization and delocalization coexist in a very narrow range of energies. Most notably, beyond the simply smoothed bands found in previous disorder studies, islands of transport emerge in band gaps and sharp band boundaries persist in the presence of substantial disorder. Finally, the family of materials comes with rather direct specifications of how to assemble the requisite material organizations.},

abstract = {Thermal states are the bedrock of statistical physics. Nevertheless, when and how they actually arise in closed quantum systems is not fully understood. We consider this question for systems with local Hamiltonians on finite quantum lattices. In a first step, we show that states with exponentially decaying correlations equilibrate after a quantum quench. Then, we show that the equilibrium state is locally equivalent to a thermal state, provided that the free energy of the equilibrium state is sufficiently small and the thermal state has exponentially decaying correlations. As an application, we look at a related important question: When are thermal states stable against noise? In other words, if we locally disturb a closed quantum system in a thermal state, will it return to thermal equilibrium? We rigorously show that this occurs when the correlations in the thermal state are exponentially decaying. All our results come with finite-size bounds, which are crucial for the growing field of quantum thermodynamics and other physical applications. To understand the strengths and limitations of statistical physics, it makes sense to derive it from physical principles, without ad hoc assumptions. Along these lines, over the past twenty years, ideas from quantum information have given new insights into the foundations of statistical physics [1–3]. In particular, some progress was made towards understanding how and when thermalization occurs [4–6]. A large class of states of systems with weak intensive interactions (e.g., one dimensional systems) were shown to thermalize [5]. In [6], thermalization was also proved for a large class of states, in the thermodynamic limit. (We will compare the results of [6] to our results in detail below.) More recently, the equivalence of the micro-canonical and canonical ensemble (i.e., thermal state) was proved for finite quantum lattice systems, when correla-tions in the thermal state decay sufficiently quickly [7] (see, also, [6,8]). Here, we prove thermalization results for closed quan-tum systems in two parts. First, we build upon previous equilibration results (e.g., Refs. [9,10]). A requirement for equilibration is that the effective dimension, defined below, is large. While there are physical arguments for this in some cases [11] (and it is true for most states drawn from the Haar measure on large subspaces [10]), there are no techniques for deciding whether a given initial state will equilibrate under a given Hamiltonian. Here, we prove that a large effective dimension is guaranteed for local Hamiltonian systems if the correlations in the initial state decay sufficiently quickly and the energy variance is sufficiently large. The latter is known for thermal states with intensive specific heat capacity and may, for large classes of states, be computed straightforwardly. The second part of thermalization is to show that the equilibrium state is locally indistinguishable from a thermal state. We prove that this occurs if the correlations in the corresponding thermal state decay sufficiently quickly and the relative entropy difference between the equili-brium state and the corresponding thermal state is suffi-ciently small. As an application, we answer the following question. Given a closed quantum system that is initially in a thermal state, and supposing we locally quench or disturb it, will it reequilibrate to a thermal state? Understanding when thermal states are robust against local external noise is important, e.g., in decohering quantum simulations imple-mented in optical lattice systems (see, e.g., Ref. [12] and references therein), where noise can be caused by the absorption and reemission of a photon. Questions of reequilibration have a long tradition, and return to equi-librium was shown for infinite lattice systems in the seventies [13,14] by making transport assumptions: On an infinite lattice, information may leave a region and never return, which is not true for finite systems. This funda-mental difference highlights the importance of finite-size considerations. We discuss the connection to results on infinite lattices further in [15]. Return to equilibrium was also shown for finite quantum systems coupled to infinite reservoirs after a coupling has been turned on [19,20], and a rough argument for stability of thermal states was given recently in terms of energy probability distributions in [21]. Here, we prove that a system in a thermal state, after being locally disturbed, reequilibrates to a thermal state provided correlations decay sufficiently quickly. In contrast to infinite lattice systems, our results give finite-size estimates and our methods and assumptions are entirely different. We emphasize that},

@article{Nakamura2010a,
abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate the validity of nonequilibrium fluctuation relations by using a quantum coherent conductor. In equilibrium the fluctuation-dissipation relation leads to the correlation between current and current noise at the conductor, namely, the Johnson-Nyquist relation. When the conductor is voltage biased so that the nonlinear regime is entered, the fluctuation theorem has predicted similar nonequilibrium fluctuation relations, which hold true even when the Onsager-Casmir relations are broken in magnetic fields. Our experiments qualitatively validate the predictions as the first evidence of this theorem in the nonequilibrium quantum regime. The fluctuation-dissipation relation [1] is a central concept in physics. It was triggered by the description of Brownian motion by Einstein [2], who claimed that the response of a physical system to an external force is proportional to its equilibrium fluctuation. In electrical circuits this fact manifests itself as the Johnson-Nyquist (JN) relation [3,4] in such a way that the conduction through a conductor is proportional to its current noise in equilibrium. The linear response theory [5,6] founded on this relation together with the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations [7] provides a powerful tool to describe a variety of physical systems. This is, however, justified only when the systems are close to equilibrium, and the generalization to the nonequilibrium regime has been long sought. Generally the current (I) passing through a conductor can be expressed as a polynomial of the bias voltage (V) as follows: I ¼ G 1 V þ 1 2! G 2 V 2 þ 1 3! G 3 V 3 þ {\'{A}} {\'{A}} {\'{A}} ; (1) where the first term represents Ohm's law with conduc-tance G 1 (such an expansion in V is assumed to be valid for mesoscopic transport [8]). While in a mesoscopic conductor G 1 is directly related to the transmission [9], the higher-order coefficients (G 2 ; G 3 ;. . .) convey information on electron-electron interactions in a voltage biased conductor as shown recently [10-13]. Similarly to Eq. (1), a polynomial of V for the current noise power S generated in the conductor, namely, the variance of I, can be expressed as S ¼ S 0 þ S 1 V þ 1 2! S 2 V 2 þ {\'{A}} {\'{A}} {\'{A}} : (2) The coefficients of the first terms in Eqs. (1) and (2) are linked by the JN relation S 0 ¼ 4k B TG 1 , where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the conductor [3,4,14]. Now, an essential question arises: are there also correlations between the higher orders (in voltage) in current I and noise power S? Here we demonstrate a nonequilibrium fluctuation relation in a quantum coherent regime. We find a proportion-ality between S 1 and G 2 , which corresponds to the next order correlation beyond the JN relation between S 0 and G 1. The present relation is asymmetric in magnetic fields unlike the Onsager-Casimir symmetry and is valid even in the presence of interactions. Such a direct link between nonlinearity in voltage and fluctuations out-of-equilibrium has been predicted theoretically [15-19] by applying the fluctuation theorem [20] to a quantum coherent conductor. Our experiments qualitatively validate the predictions but disagree on the quantitative level. We used an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring as a typical coherent conductor. Figure 1(a) shows an atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the AB ring fabricated by local oxidation using an AFM [21] on a GaAs=AlGaAs heterostructure two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) (the electron density 3:7 {\^{A}} 10 11 cm {\`{A}}2 , the mobility 2:7 {\^{A}} 10 5 cm 2 =V s, and the electron mean free path 2:7 m at zero back-gate voltage) as well as the experimental setup for the two-terminal measurement in a dilution refrigerator. As our 2DEG has a back gate to tune the electron density, the conductance of the AB ring can be modulated by the back-gate voltage V g and the magnetic field B (the AB effect). Figure 1(b) shows the conductance as a function of V g and B, displaying clear AB oscillations with an oscillation period being 25 mT, in agreement with the ring radius of 230 nm [13].},

abstract = {While originally motivated by quantum computation, quantum error correction (QEC) is currently providing valuable insights into many-body quantum physics such as topological phases of matter. Furthermore, mounting evidence originating from holography research (AdS/CFT), indicates that QEC should also be pertinent for conformal field theories. With this motivation in mind, we introduce quantum source-channel codes, which combine features of lossy-compression and approximate quantum error correction, both of which are predicted in holography. Through a recent construction for approximate recovery maps, we derive guarantees on its erasure decoding performance from calculations of an entropic quantity called conditional mutual information. As an example, we consider Gibbs states of the transverse field Ising model at criticality and provide evidence that they exhibit non-trivial protection from local erasure. This gives rise to the first concrete interpretation of a bona fide conformal field theory as a quantum error correcting code. We argue that quantum source-channel codes are of independent interest beyond holography.},

@article{Jurcevic2014,
abstract = {The key to explaining and controlling a range of quantum phenom-ena is to study how information propagates around many-body sys-tems. Quantum dynamics can be described by particle-like carriers of information that emerge in the collective behaviour of the underlying system, the so-called quasiparticles 1 . These elementary excitations are predicted to distribute quantum information in a fashion deter-mined by the system's interactions 2 . Here we report quasiparticle dynamics observed in a quantum many-body system of trapped atomic ions 3,4 . First, we observe the entanglement distributed by quasiparticles as they trace out light-cone-like wavefronts 5–11 . Second, using the ability to tune the interaction range in our system, we observe informa-tion propagation in an experimental regime where the effective-light-cone picture does not apply 7,12 . Our results will enable experimental studies of a range of quantum phenomena, including transport 13,14 , thermalization 15 , localization 16 and entanglement growth 17 , and rep-resent a first step towards a new quantum-optic regime of engineered quasiparticles with tunable nonlinear interactions. Experimental study of the quantum coherent properties of quasipar-ticles represents a significant challenge over a broad range of disciplines, from investigating the propagation of quantum correlations by magnons or phonons in naturally occurring systems, to creating exotic anyons in engineered quantum matter for topological quantum technology 18 . Very recently, in an engineered system of 10 to 18 atoms in an optical lattice 9,10 , the propagation of correlations by magnons was observed. Detecting the quantum nature of the correlations distributed by quasiparticles (that is, entanglement) has not yet been achieved. We present experiments in an engineered one-dimensional system of atomic ions, whose dynamics are accurately described by a lattice model of interacting spins. The salient features of our system are as follows: first, we are able to inject localized excitations into the system and, in the subsequent dynamics, measure arbitrary multi-particle correlation func-tions, thereby allowing the possibility of detecting and quantifying en-tanglement. Second, we can tune the ion–ion interaction range from effectively nearest-neighbour to infinite range. In each case, a new set of quasiparticles is created with unique dynamical properties. In contrast to quantum simulation, where one aims to study computationally complex processes, our goal is to manipulate individual quasiparticles and their properties precisely, and observe the information and quantum correla-tions that they transport. In any quantum system with finite-range interactions (for example, nearest-neighbour), quasiparticles have a finite maximal velocity, known as the Lieb–Robinson velocity 5,19,20},

@article{Singh2011,
abstract = {As the title says we want to answer the question; how and why does statistical mechanics work? As we know from the most used prescription of Gibbs we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and we find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time. Thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity. Aim of the present review is to show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics (with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution of the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables and with the very large number of the degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first pointed out by Khinchin. Similar arguments are used by Landau based upon the approximate property of "Statistical Independence". We review these ideas in detail and in some cases present a critique. We review the role of chaos (classical and quantum) where it is important and where it is not important. We criticise the ideas of E. T. Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is conceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by-product of frequency theory of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the probabilities of various micro-states are interpreted with Laplace-Bernoulli theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint). In the end we critically review various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality approaches) to the foundations of statistical mechanics.},

@article{Carberry2004a,
abstract = {The puzzle of how time-reversible microscopic equations of mechanics lead to the time-irreversible macroscopic equations of thermodynamics has been a paradox since the days of Boltzmann. Boltzmann simply sidestepped this enigma by stating ''as soon as one looks at bodies of such small dimension that they contain only very few molecules, the validity of this theorem [the second law of thermodynamics and its description of irreversibility] must cease.'' Today we can state that the transient fluctuation theorem (TFT) of Evans and Searles is a generalized, second-law-like theorem that bridges the microscopic and macroscopic domains and links the time-reversible and irreversible descriptions. We apply this theorem to a colloidal particle in an optical trap. For the first time, we demonstrate the TFT in an experiment and show quantitative agreement with Langevin dynamics. The second law of thermodynamics [1,2] states that for systems in the thermodynamic limit, the entropy produc-tion must be greater than or equal to zero. Although the underlying equations of motion are time reversible, the second law predicts an irreversible entropy production. This law applies to systems that are of infinite size and persist over long times. Despite this strict limitation, the second law is often treated as being universal in applica-tion because the size of most systems can be considered infinite when compared to atomic length and time scales. However, several systems of current scientific interest, such as nanomachines and protein motors, operate at length and time scales where the system cannot be con-sidered infinite. At the nano-and microscales the thermal energy available per degree of freedom can be compa-rable to the work performed by the system. Classical thermodynamics does not apply to these small systems. In 1993 the first quantitative description of entropy production in finite systems was given by the fluctuation theorem (FT) of Evans et al. [3]. In its most general form, the theorem provides an analytic expression for the probability that a dissipative flux flows in the direction opposite to that required by the second law of thermody-namics. For thermostated dissipative systems [4] the theorem relates the probability of observing a process of duration t with entropy production t  A dA, P t  A, to that of a process with the same magnitude of entropy change, but where the entropy is consumed, rather than produced: P t  A P t  {\"{y}}A  exp A: (1)},

After briefly summarising the quantification of entanglement using these and related ideas, we arrive at the concept of quantum discord that naturally captures the boundary between entanglement and classical correlations. Finally we discuss possible links between discord and the generation of correlations in thermodynamic transformations of coupled harmonic oscillators.},

As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a super ̄uid to a Mott insulator phase. In the super ̄uid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t We study dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems whose Hamiltonian is switched between two different operators periodically in time. The eigenvalue problem of the associated Flo-quet operator maps onto an effective hopping problem. Using the effective model, we establish conditions on the spectral properties of the two Hamiltonians for the system to localize in energy space. We find that ergodic systems always delocalize in energy space and heat up to infinite temperature, for both local and global driving. In contrast, many-body localized systems with quenched disorder re-main localized at finite energy. We support our conclusions by nu-merical simulations of disordered spin chains. We argue that our results hold for general driving protocols, and discuss their exper-imental implications.},

abstract = {We examine localization phenomena associated with generic, high entropy, states of a translation-invariant, one-dimensional spin ladder. At early times, we find slow growth of entanglement entropy consistent with the known phenomenology of many-body localization in disordered, interacting systems. At intermediate times, however, anomalous diffusion sets in, leading to full spin polarization decay on an exponentially activated time scale. We identify a single length scale which parametrically controls both the spin transport times and the apparent divergence of the susceptibility to spin glass ordering. Ultimately, at the latest times, the exponentially slow anomalous diffusion gives way to diffusive thermal behavior. We dub the intermediate dynamical behavior, which persists over many orders of magnitude in time, quasi-many-body localization. Understanding the interplay between interactions and disorder in quantum dynamics is among the central chal-lenges in many-body physics. Since its proposal in 1958 [1], Anderson localization has been observed in disordered systems composed of photons, phonons, electrons, and ultracold atoms [2–4]. The physics of localization in each of these systems can be largely understood as a single-particle phenomenon. Extending disordered localization to the interacting many-body regime has attracted significant recent attention [5–38], in part, because it represents a fundamental breakdown of quantum statistical mechanics. This breakdown opens the door to a number of possibilities, including novel phase transitions in high-energy states, the protection of quantum and topological orders, and even the possibility of quantum information processing with disor-dered many-body systems [17,21,24,33,39,40]. A number of recent proposals have investigated the possibility that localization can persist even in the absence of disorder [34,35,41–45]. This idea can be traced back to early work on 3 He defects dissolved in solid 4 He [46,47]. There, it was proposed that a uniform system of strongly interacting narrow bandwidth particles could self-localize: A subset of the 3 He defects form immobile clusters which,},

The shaped pulses were shown to be phase-sensitive at intensities too low to access different higher electronic states, and so these pulses apparently steer the isomerization through constructive and destructive interference effects, a mechanism supported by observed signatures of vibrational coherence.

These quantities are believed to control dynamics and thermalization in low-dimensional atomic gases as well as in quantum spin chains. But what happens when the special symmetries leading to the existence of the extra conserved quantities are broken? Is there any memory of the quantities if the breaking is weak? Here, in the presence of weak integrability breaking, we show that it is possible to construct residual quasiconserved quantities, thus providing a quantum analog to the KAM theorem and its attendant Nekhoreshev estimates. We demonstrate this construction explicitly in the context of quantum quenches in one-dimensional Bose gases and argue that these quasiconserved quantities can be probed experimentally.},

In this review I will show how quantum information theory extends traditional information theory by exploring the limits imposed by quantum, rather than classical mechanics on information storage and transmission. The derivation of many key results uniquely differentiates this review from the "usual" presentation in that they are shown to follow logically from one crucial property of relative entropy. Within the review optimal bounds on the speed-up that quantum computers can achieve over their classical counter-parts are outlined using information theoretic arguments. In addition important implications of quantum information theory to thermodynamics and quantum measurement are intermittently discussed. A number of simple examples and derivations including quantum super-dense coding, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's and Grover's algorithms are also included.},

E 83, 041114 (2011)], we find that these fluctuation relations are satisfied for projective measurements; however, for generalized measurements special conditions on the operators determining the measurements need to be met. For the Jarzynski equality to hold, the measurement operators of the forward protocol must be normalized in a particular way. The Crooks relation additionally entails that the backward and forward measurement operators depend on each other. Yet, quite some freedom is left as to how the two sets of operators are interrelated. This ambiguity is removed if one considers selective measurements, which are specified by a joint probability density function of work and measurement results of the considered observable. We find that the respective forward and backward joint probabilities satisfy the Crooks relation only if the measurement operators of the forward and backward protocols are the time-reversed adjoints of each other. In this case, the work probability density function conditioned on the measurement result satisfies a modified Crooks relation. The modification appears as a protocol-dependent factor that can be expressed by the information gained by the measurements during the forward and backward protocols. Finally, detailed fluctuation theorems with an arbitrary number of intervening measurements are obtained.},

The result is based on the observation that the time taken by any system to move to a distinguishable (nearly orthogonal) quantum state is a universal quantity that depends solely on the temperature.

abstract = {A modified fluctuation-dissipation theorem for a nonequilibrium steady state is experimentally checked by studying the position fluctuations of a colloidal particle whose motion is confined in a toroidal optical trap. The nonequilibrium steady state is generated by means of a rotating laser beam which exerts on the particle a sinusoidal conservative force plus a constant nonconservative one. The modified fluctuation-dissipation theorem is perfectly verified by the experimental data. It can be interpreted as an equilibrium-like fluctuation-dissipation relation in the Lagrangian frame of the mean local velocity of the particle. The validity of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) in systems out of thermal equilibrium has been the subject of intensive study during the past years. We recall that, for a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature T, the FDT establishes a simple relation between the two-time correlation function Cðt {\`{A}} sÞ of a given observable and the linear response function Rðt {\`{A}} sÞ of this observable to a weak external perturbation @ s Cðt {\`{A}} sÞ ¼ k B TRðt {\`{A}} sÞ: (1) However, Eq. (1) is not necessarily fulfilled out of equilibrium , and violations are observed in a variety of systems such as glassy materials [1-5], granular matter [6], and biophysical systems [7]. This motivated a theoretical work devoted to a search of a general framework describing FD relations; see the review [8] or [9-14] for recent attempts in simple stochastic systems. In the same spirit, a modified fluctuation-dissipation theorem (MFDT) has been recently formulated for a nonequilibrium steady dynamics governed by the Langevin equation with nonconservative forces [15]. In particular, this MFDT holds for the over-damped motion of a particle on a circle, with angular position , in the presence of a periodic potential HðÞ ¼ Hð þ 2Þ and a constant nonconservative force F: {\_} ¼ {\`{A}}@ HðÞ þ F þ ; (2) where is a white noise term of mean h t i ¼ 0 and covariance h t s i ¼ 2Dðt {\`{A}} sÞ, with D the (bare) diffu-sivity. This is a system that may exhibit an increase in the effective diffusivity [16,17]. Here we shall study the dy-namical nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) reached for observables that depend only on the particle position on the circle and so are periodic functions of the angle. Such a state corresponds to a constant nonvanishing probability current j along the circle and a periodic invariant probability density function 0 ðÞ that allow us to define a mean local velocity v 0 ðÞ ¼ j= 0 ðÞ. This is the average velocity of the particle at. For a stochastic system in NESS evolving according to Eq. (2), the MFDT reads for t ! s @ s Cðt {\`{A}} sÞ {\`{A}} bðt {\`{A}} sÞ ¼ k B TRðt {\`{A}} sÞ; (3) where the two-time correlation of a given observable OðÞ is defined by Cðt {\`{A}} sÞ ¼ hOð t ÞOð s Þi 0 ; (4) and the linear response function to a perturbation of the conjugated variable h t is given by the functional derivative Rðt {\`{A}} sÞ ¼ h s h¼0 hOð t Þi h : (5) In Eq. (5), h.. .i h denotes the average in the perturbed time-dependent state obtained from the NESS by replacing HðÞ in Eq. (2) by HðÞ {\`{A}} h t OðÞ. It reduces for h ¼ 0 to the NESS average h.. .i 0. In Eq. (3), the correlation bðt {\`{A}} sÞ is given by bðt {\`{A}} sÞ ¼ hOð t Þv 0 ð s Þ@ Oð s Þi 0 : (6) This new term takes into account the extent of the violation of the usual fluctuation-dissipation relation (1) due to the probability current, and it plays the role of a corrective term to Cðt {\`{A}} sÞ in the MFDT [Eq. (3)], which can be rewritten in the integral form Cð0Þ {\`{A}} CðtÞ {\`{A}} BðtÞ ¼ k B TðtÞ; (7) where BðtÞ R t 0 bðt {\`{A}} sÞds and ðtÞ ¼ R t 0 Rðt {\`{A}} sÞds is the integrated response function. In this Letter, we present an experimental test of Eq. (7) in the linear response regime around a NESS attained by a micron-sized particle in a toroidal optical trap similar to the one used in [12]. We first show that the dynamics of the particle is well described by the Langevin equation (2) on a circle. Second, by measuring v 0 , BðtÞ, CðtÞ, and ðtÞ, we verify Eq. (7) for the observable OðÞ ¼ sin. The result can be interpreted as an equilibriumlike fluctuation-dissipation relation in the Lagrangian frame of the mean PRL 103,},

Unlike previous works, we do not restrict ourselves to the limit where the bath is large and effectively Markovian, nor to the limit where back action on the bath is negligible. We identify limits where the effect of the bath can be captured by classical noise, and limits where it cannot. We also identify limits in which the bath delocalizes the system, as well as limits in which the system localizes the bath. Using general arguments and dimensional analysis, we constrain the overall phase diagram of the coupled system and bath. Our analysis incorporates all the previously discussed regimes, and also uncovers a new intrinsically quantum regime that has not hitherto been discussed. We discuss baths that are themselves near a localization transition, or are strongly disordered but protected against localization by symmetry or topology. We also discuss situations where the system and bath have different dimensionality (the case of `boundary MBL' and `boundary baths').},

abstract = {Motivated by the findings of logarithmic spreading of entanglement in a many-body localized system, we identify and untangle two factors contributing to the spreading of entanglement in the fully many-body localized phase, where all many-body eigenstates are localized. Performing full diagonalizations of an XXZ spin model with random longitudinal fields, we demonstrate a linear dependence of the spreading rate on the decay length ($\xi$) of the effective interaction between localized pseudospins (l-bits), which depends on the disorder strength, and on the final value of entanglement per spin (s ∞), which primarily depends on the initial state. The entanglement entropy thus grows with time as ∼$\xi$ × s ∞ log t, providing support for the phenomenology of many-body localized systems proposed by Huse and Oganesyan.},

abstract = {The many-body problem is ubiquitous in the theoretical description of physical phenomena, ranging from the behavior of elementary particles to the physics of electrons in solids. Most of our understanding of many-body systems comes from analyzing the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian and states: the most striking example are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of systems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several approaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge theories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation platforms have been put forward for the realization of synthetic gauge theories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum information concepts have been formulated. In this review we present an introduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and highlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and report the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.},

abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics places a limitation into which states a system can evolve into. For systems in contact with a heat bath, it can be combined with the law of energy conservation, and it says that a system can only evolve into another if the free energy goes down. Recently, it's been shown that there are actually many second laws, and that it is only for large macroscopic systems that they all become equivalent to the ordinary one. These additional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often more relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities of energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how the coherences between energy levels can evolve. Coherences can only go down, and we provide a set of restrictions which limit the extent to which they can be maintained. We find that coherences over energy levels must decay at rates that are suitably adapted to the transition rates between energy levels. We show that the limitations are matched in the case of a single qubit, in which case we obtain the full characterization of state-to-state transformations. For higher dimensions, we conjecture that more severe constraints exist. We also introduce a new class of thermodynamical operations which allow for greater manipulation of coherences and study its power with respect to a class of operations known as thermal operations. We consider a quantum system in state $\rho$ S which can be put in contact with a reservoir at temperature T. The second law of thermodynamics, combined with the first law (conservation of energy) states that the free energy F ¼ TrðH$\rho$ S Þ − TSð$\rho$ S Þ ð 1Þ can only decrease, where Sð$\rho$ S Þ is the von Neumann entropy (one can also take the course grained entropy, but since we are interested in small quantum systems where all degrees of freedom can be precisely measured, in principle, taking the von Neumann entropy will help us answer the questions we are interested in here.) Sð$\rho$Þ ¼ −Tr$\rho$ log $\rho$ and H is the system's Hamiltonian. Although this is a necessary constraint on what state transformations are possible, we now know that it is not sufficient. For transitions between two states, diagonal in the energy basis, there are a set of necessary and sufficient conditions which must be satisfied in order for a state to transform into another state. One has a family of free energies in the case of catalytic processes [1] (i.e., where one is allowed an ancilla which can be returned to its original state in the spirit of theClausius-Planck formulation of the second law). For noncatalytic transformations, the set of necessary and sufficient conditions were proven to be majorization [2] in the case when the Hamiltonian is H ¼ 0 and thermomajo-rization [3] in general. It is only in the thermodynamic limit that all these conditions become equivalent to the ordinary second law of Eq. (1). However, for single finite systems (sometimes called the single-shot scenario), the full set of conditions is relevant. It is this finite regime which is more relevant for quantum systems or even in the meso-scopic regime, especially if long range interactions are present. Regarding states that are not diagonal in the energy basis, thermomajorization (or the generalized free energies of Ref. [1] in the catalytic case) are still necessary conditions for state transformations and place conditions on the diagonal entries of the state $\rho$ S (where we assume that $\rho$ S is written in the energy eigenbasis). But these conditions do not say anything about how off-diagonal elements between different energies behave. Partial results were obtained in Refs. [1,3] for the case where only the input state is nondiagonal and simultaneously posted with this Letter, in Ref. [4], where relations between purity and quantum asymmetry in the spirit of coherences have been formulated and the authors obtained the "free-energy relation" for coherences (second law). However, finding a complete set of quantum limitations is still a challenge. Here, by providing a first systematic approach to coher-ences, we will present a set of conditions, called damping matrix positivity (DMP). Unlike the results of Refs. [1,3], they are not necessary and sufficient, although we will show that they are for the case of a qubit.},

abstract = {Billiards are idealizations for systems where particles or waves are confined to cavities, or to other homogeneous regions. In billiard systems a point particle moves freely except for specular reflections from rigid walls. However, billiard walls are not always completely reflective and measurements inside can also open the billiard. Since boundary openings have been studied extensively in the literature, we rather model leakages inside the billiard. In particular, we investigate the classical dynamics of a leakage for a continuous family of billiard systems, that is, the stadium-lemon-billiard family. With a single parameter the geometry of the billiard can be tuned from stadium (being fully hyperbolic) over circle (integrable) to the lemon-shaped billiard (mixed chaotic). For the stadium billiard we found an algebraically decaying mean escape time with the linear size of the leakage n(esc) approximately epsilon-1 together with an exponential decay of the survival probability distribution. The finding is nearly independent of the position and size of the leakage, as long as the leakage is much smaller than the system size, and it is in good agreement with a stochastic map approximation of the dynamics. Due to the mixed phase space for lemon billiards, the mean escape time depends both on the position and geometry of the leakage. For systems where quasiregular motion dominates, we found a linear dependence of the mean escape time, n(esc) approximately 1-epsilon, which we refer to as flooding law. Our findings are helpful in understanding dynamics of leaking Hamiltonian systems.},

Both C ␮ and SC define complexity with use of a minimal metric DFA ͑i.e., one in which transition probabilities between nodes are recorded͒, that represents a shift dynamical system, and each presents some problems in the construction of the DFA, as will be explained below. In this paper we offer a prescription which avoids the explicit construction of the DFA, and which yields finite complexity values for sofic systems; these coincide with regular lan-guages: see Ref. ͓2͔, pp. 80 and 81.

@article{Kumar2018,
abstract = {In 1872, Maxwell proposed his famous 'demon' thought experiment 1. By discerning which particles in a gas are hot and which are cold, and then performing a series of reversible actions, Maxwell's demon could rearrange the particles into a manifestly lower-entropy state. This apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics was resolved by twentieth-century theoretical work 2 : the entropy of the Universe is often increased while gathering information 3 , and there is an unavoidable entropy increase associated with the demon's memory 4. The appeal of the thought experiment has led many real experiments to be framed as demon-like. However, past experiments had no intermediate information storage 5 , yielded only a small change in the system entropy 6,7 or involved systems of four or fewer particles 8-10. Here we present an experiment that captures the full essence of Maxwell's thought experiment. We start with a randomly half-filled three-dimensional optical lattice with about 60 atoms. We make the atoms sufficiently vibrationally cold so that the initial disorder is the dominant entropy. After determining where the atoms are, we execute a series of reversible operations to create a fully filled sublattice, which is a manifestly low-entropy state. Our sorting process lowers the total entropy of the system by a factor of 2.44. This highly filled ultracold array could be used as the starting point for a neutral-atom quantum computer. With an eye towards quantum computing and quantum simulation applications, there has been a recent boom in cold-atom sorting experiments. Atoms in a variety of arrays of dipole light traps have been impressively rearranged by moving individual traps 6,7,11,12. The entropy associated with disordered occupancy in those cases is at most about 10{\%} of the system entropy 6 , which is dominated by vibra-tional excitation in the traps. Good vibrational cooling, along with well-sorted atoms, is required for cold collision-based quantum gates or quantum simulations. For Rydberg-based gates or simulations 13 , although atoms are not strictly required to be vibrationally cold, colder is better. Rydberg gates using colder atoms are likely to yield higher fidelity because the atoms are less likely to change vibrational states during the gate, which can undesirably entangle atomic motion with qubit states. In general, better-localized atoms allow higher-fidelity addressing of individual atoms 14. In blue-detuned traps, cold atoms see less light and thus scatter fewer trapping photons, which leads to longer coherence times. For instance, the coherence time in our experiment now exceeds 12 s. Four atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice 8 have been com-pacted using a method 15 similar to the one that we demonstrate here with 50 atoms in three dimensions. We note that at least about 50 qubits are needed for a quantum computer to perform a calculation that cannot be accomplished on a classical computer 16. A three-dimensional (3D) geometry gives atoms many more nearby neighbours, which provides higher connectivity in the system. It also allows for a broad range of quantum simulations and is favourable for further scaling of the number of atoms in the system. Our experiment proceeds as follows. We prepare a randomly 56{\%}-filled blue-detuned 3D lattice with 4.8 $\mu$m lattice spacing 17. By imaging polarization-gradient-cooling laser light, we determine the occupancy across the lattice with an error of 10 −3 per site in 800 ms (ref. 17). Projection sideband cooling 18 puts 89{\%} of the caesium atoms into their vibrational ground states and {\textgreater}99.7{\%} of them in the |F = 4, m F = −4〉 hyperfine ground state, where F and m F are the hyper-fine and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively. We then combine the ability to address atoms at individual sites (by using crossed laser beams and microwaves to make site-dependent state changes 19) with the ability to make state-dependent lattice translations (by rotating the lattice beam polarizations 20). Starting from a given 3D occupancy map we devise a sequence of operations to fill up either a 5 × 5 × 2 or a 4 × 4 × 3 sublattice. We can target any site in a 5 × 5 × 5 lattice by using a pair of focused addressing beams intersecting at a right angle 14,19. Targeting proceeds as in our previous demonstration of high-fidelity single-qubit gates 14 , but the magnetic sublevels are different and in this case we are unconcerned with long-term quantum coherence. The addressing beams shift the (|F = 4, m F = −4〉 to |F = 3, m F = −3〉 resonance by around 50 kHz, which allows us to drive the associated microwave transition using an adiabatic fast-passage pulse (see Methods for details) that transfers only the target atom. An atom making the transition from m F = −4 to m F = −3 moves from the 'stationary' to the 'motion' state. The linear polarizations of the two beams that create the lattice in a given direction are initially aligned, so the two states are trapped nearly identically. When the polarization of one of the lattice beams is rotated (using two electro-optic modulators and a $\lambda$/4 plate, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength), the optical lattices for the two states move in opposite directions (see Fig. 1a). After rotating the polarization by $\pi$, we optically pump the atoms back to the stationary state and rotate the polarization back. The net effect of this sequence is that atoms that start in the stationary state move but return to the same place, while atoms that start in the motion state are shifted by one lattice site. The sorting algorithm for compacting atoms in the lattice was proposed in previous work 15,21 ; we have slightly modified it to allow the filling of any continuous sublattice (see Methods). The general idea is to first perform a series of balancing steps in the x and y directions so that every row in the z direction has the required number of atoms to fill a desired number of planes. Then, a series of compaction steps in the z direction moves atoms to fill the planes of the target sublattice (Fig. 1b). For example, to fill a 5 × 5 × 2 sublattice from a half-filled 5 × 5 × 5 lattice, atoms are first 'balanced' in the x and y directions so that every row in the z direction has at least two atoms. Parallel z-motion steps then move the atoms to the desired planes. After sorting, we reimage the atoms and repeat the procedure to correct any errors. The ability to know exactly where the vacancies are is an advantage of this approach to filling a lattice compared to implementing a superfluid-Mott insula-tor transition 22 , where residual occupancy errors are unknown. Figure 2 shows two implementations of this algorithm, in which target sublattices were completely filled after two sorts. In general, starting with at least half the lattice sites filled in a 5 × 5 × 5 array, three sorts leave us with an average filling fraction of 0.97 for 5 × 5 × 2 and 0.95 for 4 × 4 × 3.

abstract = {The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the dierences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that the GGE describes spin–spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.},

abstract = {By its very nature, the second law of thermodynamics is probabilistic, in that its formulation requires a probabilistic description of the state of a system. This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much eeort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field. S oon after the discovery of the second law of thermodynamics, James Clerk Maxwell illustrated the probabilistic nature of the law with a gedanken experiment, now known as Maxwell's demon 1,2 . He argued that if an intelligent being—a demon—had information about the velocities and positions of the particles in a gas, then that demon could transfer the fast, hot particles from a cold reservoir to a hot one, in apparent violation of the second law 1,2 . Maxwell's demon revealed the relationship between entropy and information for the first time—demonstrating that, by using information, one can relax the restrictions imposed by the second law on the energy exchanged between a system and its surroundings. But formulations of the second law attributed to Rudolf Clausius, Lord Kelvin and Max Planck 3 make no mention of information. Reconciling these two pictures involves two separate tasks. First, we must refine the second law to incorporate information explicitly. And second, we must clarify the physical nature of information, so that it enters the second law not as an abstraction, but as a physical entity. In this way, information manipulations such as measurement, erasure, copying and feedback can be thought of as physical operations with thermodynamic costs. The first task was partially accomplished by L{\'{e}}o Szil{\'{a}}rd, who devised a stylized version of Maxwell's demon. Szil{\'{a}}rd's demon exploits one bit of information (the outcome of an unbiased yes/no measurement) to implement a cyclic process that extracts kT ln 2 of energy as work from a thermal reservoir at temperature T , where k is Boltzmann's constant 4 . This suggests a quantitative relationship between the information used by the demon and the extractable work from a single thermal reservoir. Efforts to address the second task have been many and varied 1,2 . L{\'{e}}on Brillouin quantified the cost of measurement in some specific situations; Marian Smoluchowski 5 and Richard Feynman 6 demon-strated that fluctuations prevent apparent second-law violations in autonomous demons; and Rolf Landauer, Charles Bennett and Oliver Penrose 7 proved that measurements can be realized at zero entropy production—albeit at an energetic cost for measurement erasure 1 . Bennett subsequently explored several thermodynamic aspects of information processing 8 , including compression, algo-rithmic complexity, logical reversibility and proofreading. Despite this long history of information in thermodynamics, the past decade has seen significant progress due to the application of fluctuation theorems 9,10 and stochastic thermodynamics 11,12 . They have provided a general framework for the thermodynamics of information that clarifies and generalizes previous results. In parallel with this theoretical progress, technological advances have led to new experimental techniques for manipulating small fluctuating systems. As a result, the thought experiments of the past, such as Maxwell's demon and Szil{\'{a}}rd's engine, are now being realized in the laboratory 13,14 , allowing the verification of several fundamental predictions regarding information operations 15,16 . Our aim in this article is to complement the existing review literature 1,2,11,12,17–19 by presenting an updated overview of the recent developments and experiments, as well as to provide a basic introduction to the main ideas and theoretical tools used to analyse the thermodynamics of information systems. After reviewing the Szil{\'{a}}rd engine, we will discuss how information can be incorporated into a refined statement of the second law, and then continue by analysing physical realizations of memories and information processing.},

This problem can be mapped onto a variety of physical problems, including one-dimensional particle or excitation diffusion with random spatial transfer rates er random trap depths, low-temperature properties of the random one-dirnensional Heisenberg ferromagnet, one-dimensional tight-binding fermion systems with correlated diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and electrical lines of random conductances or capacitances. Replacing dP"/dt by d 'P"/dt ', the above equations also describe a harmonic chain with random force constants or random masses. Both the random 8'and the random C problem are shown to reduce to the same mathematical problem, and the authors review the derivation and consequences of its exact asymptotic solution for some general classes of probability densities. In particular, they are able to determine the exact co{\~{}}0 asymptotic behavior of the single-site Cireen function, and thus the low-energy density of states and (for diffusion-type problems) the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function. For diffusion-type problems, the investigators further introduce a scaling hypothesis (based on the assumption of the existence of a single characteristic length) for the time dependence of the excitation amplitude at sites other than the initially excited site. This allows the calculation of the low-frequency diffusion constant, and with the help of the Einstein relation, the low-frequency conductivity. The authors apply their results to several physical systems and, in particular, are able to account quantitatively for the complex low-frequency conductivity of the one-dimensional superionic conductor hollandite. The results may also be relevant to quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems for times (or frequencies) such that diffusion is restricted to a single dimension. The expansion of an earlier scaling approach gives additional insight into the physical meaning of the asymptotic solutions. The researchers further discuss effective-medium-type approximations, which, apart from a numerical prefactor, lead to the correct asymptotic dependences. Comparison is made with the results of alternative approaches to this type of problem, specifically with those of the continuous time random walk. The authors exhibit the remarkable satisfaction of the hyperscaling relations for the specific heat and correlation function critical exponents for the random Heisenberg ferromagnet, even though the exponents themselves are not universal. Finally, aspects of the problem which remain unsolved, or which are only partly resolved, are discussed, These include the derivation of asymptotic expansions beyond the leading term, the derivation of rigorous .asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, the calculation of fluctuations in the site occupancy probabilities for the diffusion problem, and the treatment of the random one-dimensional antiferromagnet and random one-dimensional xy model. The investigators close with a short description of an application of this work to electronic conduction in highly anisotropic materials.},

The dynamics lead to a mixed phase space where chaotic orbits have a free path to move along the velocity axis, presenting a normal diffusion behavior. Depending on the control parameter, one can observe the presence of featured resonances, known as accelerator modes, that lead to a ballistic growth of velocity. Through statistical and numerical analysis of the velocity of the particle, we are able to characterize a transition between the two regimes, where transport properties were used to characterize the scenario of the ballistic regime. Also, in an analysis of the probability of an orbit to reach an accelerator mode as a function of the velocity, we observe a competition between the normal and ballistic transport in the midrange velocity.},

@article{Huber2018,
abstract = {We report on the observation of nearly maximally entangled photon pairs from semiconductor quantum dots, without resorting to postselection techniques. We use GaAs quantum dots integrated on a patterned piezoelectric actuator capable of suppressing the exciton fine structure splitting. By using a resonant two-photon excitation, we coherently drive the biexciton state and demonstrate experimentally that our device generates polarization-entangled photons with a fidelity of 0.978(5) and a concurrence of 0.97(1) taking into account the nonidealities stemming from the experimental setup. By combining fine-structure-dependent fidelity measurements and a theoretical model, we identify an exciton spin-scattering process as a possible residual decoherence mechanism. We suggest that this imperfection may be overcome using a modest Purcell enhancement so as to achieve fidelities {\textgreater} 0.99, thus making quantum dots evenly matched with the best probabilistic entangled photon sources. For the implementation of quantum computation and communication protocols, highly entangled photons are a fundamental building block [1,2]. So far, the state of the art sources for the generation of near maximal entangled photon states are based on parametric-down-conversion (PDC) processes, where fidelities larger than 0.99 have been reported [3-6]. However, such sources of entangled photons are not ideal for quantum communication protocols due to lack of on-demand emission. A potential solution to this hurdle is provided by semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which can generate pairs of polarization entangled photons via the biexciton (XX)-exciton (X) cascade [7-10]. This approach is promising for applications, not only because QDs are compatible with current photonic integration technologies but, in particular, because photons can be generated on-demand [11], with high efficiency and with a high degree of indistinguishability [12,13]. Up to now, the on-demand photon-pair preparation with near-unity degree of entanglement has remained elusive. This hurdle is related to the presence of several decoherence mechanisms typical of the solid state system. The most prominent obstacle is related to the presence of an energy splitting between the two intermediate X states, the so-called fine structure splitting (FSS) [14]. Strictly speaking, a static FSS is not a source of decoherence per se, but leads to an evolution of the entangled state over time according to [15] j$\psi$i ¼ 1= ffiffi ffi 2 p ðjH XX ijH X i þ e ðiSt=ℏÞ jV XX ijV X iÞ; ð1Þ where S is the FSS, t is the time between XX and X photon emission, and H XX (V XX) and H X (V X) are XX and X photons in the linear horizontal (vertical) polarization base, respectively. It is obvious that in presence of a FSS the time-averaged fidelity to an entangled Bell state is determined by the temporal resolution of the experimental setup as compared to the exciton lifetime $\tau$ 1. A possible way to circumvent this problem is temporal postselection [16-19] that, however, lowers the effective brightness of the source. Alternatively, external optics could be used to "compensate" for the evolving character of the entangled state [20-22]. Nonetheless, the need for complex and bulky optics in combination with postselection techniques makes QDs less appealing for scalable quantum technologies. It is evident from Eq. (1) that all these complications could be avoided using QDs with suppressed FSS. Among the different ways to reduce or suppress the FSS (see Refs. [23-25]), the one that exploits triaxial strain-tuning [26] is probably the most promising, as it can be used to fine-tune the FSS of arbitrary QDs to zero and also to set the emission energy to predefined values. Yet, experiments have shown that even at zero FSS the degree of entanglement is still far from being optimal [26-28]. This has highlighted the existence of additional dephasing mechanisms, most notably (i) recapture [29-31] and (ii) X spin-flip processes [32,33]. Option (i) is related to re-excitation of the intermediate X level to the XX level before its decay to the ground state. This effect can be avoided using two-photon resonant excitation [11,34] that, in turn, ensures on-demand generation of entangled photons.},

@article{Carlip1995,
abstract = {I review the classical and quantum properties of the (2 + 1)-dimensional black hole of Ba{\~{n}}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli. This solution of the Einstein field equations in three spacetime dimensions shares many of the characteristics of the Kerr black hole: it has an event horizon, an inner horizon, and an ergosphere; it occurs as an endpoint of gravitational collapse; it exhibits mass inflation; and it has a non-vanishing Hawking temperature and interesting thermodynamic properties. At the same time, its structure is simple enough to allow a number of exact computations, particularly in the quantum realm, that are impractical in 3+1 dimensions. Since the seminal work of Deser, Jackiw and 't Hooft [1–3] and Witten [4, 5], general relativity in three spacetime dimensions has become an increasingly popular model in which to explore the foundations of classical and quantum gravity [6]. But although (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity has been widely recognized as a useful laboratory for studying conceptual issues—the nature of observables, for example, and the 'problem of time'—it has been widely believed that the model is too physically unrealistic to give much insight into real gravitating systems in 3 + 1 dimensions. In particular, general relativity in 2 + 1 dimensions has no Newtonian limit [7] and no propagating degrees of freedom. It therefore came as a considerable surprise when Ba{\~{n}}ados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ) showed in 1992 that (2+1)-dimensional gravity has a black-hole solution [8]. The BTZ black hole differs from the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions in some important respects: it is asymptotically anti-de Sitter rather than asymptotically flat, and has no curvature singularity at the origin. Nonetheless, it is clearly a black hole: it has an event horizon and (in the rotating case) an inner horizon, it appears as the final state of collapsing matter, and it has thermodynamic properties much like those of a (3 + 1)-dimensional black hole. The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the past three years' work on the BTZ black hole. The first four sections deal with classical properties, while the last four discuss quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and possible generalizations. For the most part, I will skip complicated derivations, referring the reader instead to the literature. For a recent review with a somewhat complementary choice of topics, see [9]. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 1 I introduce the BTZ solution in standard Schwarzschild-like coordinates and in Eddington–Finkelstein and Kruskal coordinates, and summarize its basic physical characteristics. Section 2 deals with the global geometry of the (2 + 1)-dimensional black hole, and outlines its description in the Chern–Simons formulation of (2+1)-dimensional general relativity. Section 3 describes the},

Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site-resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.},

We conjecture that this path integral corresponds to a time slice of anti–de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Next, we derive a flow of quantum states by rewriting the action of Killing vectors of AdS 3 in terms of the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Both approaches support a correspon-dence between the hyperbolic time slice H 2 in AdS 3 and a version of continuous multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz. We also give a heuristic argument about why we can expect a sub-AdS scale bulk locality for holographic CFTs.},

abstract = {In loop quantum gravity the quantum states of a black hole horizon consist of pointlike discrete quantum geometry excitations (or punctures) labeled by spin j. The excitations possibly carry other internal degrees of freedom, and the associated quantum states are eigenstates of the area A operator. The appropriately scaled area operator A=ð8$\pi$lÞ can also be interpreted as the physical Hamiltonian associated with the quasilocal stationary observers located at a small distance l from the horizon. Thus, the local energy is entirely accounted for by the geometric operator A. Assuming that: Close to the horizon the quantum state has a regular energy momentum tensor and hence the local temperature measured by stationary observers is the Unruh temperature. Degeneracy of matter states is exponential with the area exp ð$\lambda$A=l 2 p Þ, which is supported by the well-established results of QFT in curved spacetimes, which do not determine $\lambda$ but assert an exponential behavior. The geometric excitations of the horizon (punctures) are indistinguishable. And finally that the semiclassical limit the area of the black hole horizon is large in Planck units. It follows that: Up to quantum corrections, matter degrees of freedom saturate the holographic bound, viz., $\lambda$ must be equal to 1 4 . Up to quantum corrections, the statistical black hole entropy coincides with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S ¼ A=ð4l 2 p Þ. The number of horizon punctures goes like N ∝ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi A=l 2 p q ; i.e., the number of punctures N remains large in the semiclassical limit. Fluctuations of the horizon area are small $\Delta$A=A ∝ ðl 2 p =AÞ 1=4 , while fluctuations of the area of an individual puncture are large (large spins dominate). A precise notion of local conformal invariance of the thermal state is recovered in the A → ∞ limit where the near horizon geometry becomes Rindler. We also show how the present model (constructed from loop quantum gravity) provides a regularization of (and gives a concrete meaning to) the formal Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path-integral treatment of the black hole system. These results offer a new scenario for semiclassical consistency of loop quantum gravity in the context of black hole physics, and suggest a concrete dynamical mechanism for large spin domination leading simultaneously to semiclassicality and continuity.},

@article{Uffink1999,
abstract = {Bohr and Heisenberg suggested that the thermodynamical quantities of temperature and energy are complementary in the same way as position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking their idea was that a definite temperature can be attributed to a system only if it is submerged in a heat bath, in which case energy fluctuations are unavoidable . On the other hand, a definite energy can be assigned only to systems in thermal isolation, thus excluding the simultaneous determination of its temperature. Rosenfeld extended this analogy with quantum mechanics and obtained a quantitative uncertainty relation in the form DU D (1/T) {\textgreater} k, where k is Boltzmann' s constant. Thetwextreme'' cases of this relation would then characterize this complementarity between isolation (U definite) and contact with a heat bath (T definite). Other formulations of the thermodynamical uncertainty relations were proposed by Mandelbrot (1956, 1989), Lindhard (1986), and Lavenda (1987, 1991). This work, however, has not led to a consensus in the literature. It is shown here that the uncertainty relation for temperature and energy in the version of Mandelbrot is indeed exactly analogous to modern formulations of the quantum mechanical uncertainty rela-tions. However, his relation holds only for the canonical distribution, describing a system in contact with a heat bath. There is, therefore, no complementarily between this situation and a thermally isolated system.},

abstract = {Statistical complexity is a measure of complexity of discrete-time stationary stochastic processes, which has many applications. We investigate its more abstract properties as a non-linear function of the space of processes and show its close relation to the Knight's prediction process. We prove lower semi-continuity, concavity, and a formula for the ergodic decomposition of statistical complexity. On the way, we show that the discrete version of the prediction process has a continuous Markov transition. We also prove that, given the past output of a partially deterministic hidden Markov model (HMM), the uncertainty of the internal state is constant over time and knowledge of the internal state gives no additional information on the future output. Using this fact, we show that the causal state distribution is the unique stationary representation on prediction space that may have finite entropy.},

abstract = {Roughly speaking, classical statistical physics is the branch of theoretical physics that aims to account for the thermal behaviour of macroscopic bodies in terms of a classical mechanical model of their microscopic constituents, with the help of probabilistic assumptions. In the last century and a half, a fair number of approaches have been developed to meet this aim. This study of their foundations assesses their coherence and analyzes the motivations for their basic assumptions, and the interpretations of their central concepts. The most outstanding foundational problems are the explanation of time-asymmetry in thermal behaviour, the relative autonomy of thermal phenomena from their microscopic underpinning, and the meaning of probability. A more or less historic survey is given of the work of Maxwell, Boltzmann and Gibbs in statis-tical physics, and the problems and objections to which their work gave rise. Next, we review some modern approaches to (i) equilibrium statistical mechanics, such as ergodic theory and the theory of the thermodynamic limit; and to (ii) non-equilibrium statistical mechanics as provided by Lanford's work on the Boltzmann equation, the so-called Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon approach, and stochastic approaches such as 'coarse-graining' and the 'open systems' approach. In all cases, we focus on the subtle interplay between probabilistic assumptions, dynamical assumptions, initial conditions and other ingredients used in these approaches.},

@article{Gour2015,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies, and that of quantifying the gap between the nonuniformity one must expend to achieve a single-shot state preparation or state conversion and the nonuniformity one can extract in the reverse operation. Quantum state-conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.},

A key challenge is the scarcity of experimental tools for the characterization of complex transient states. We used measurements of full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose gas and obtained comprehensive information about the dynamical states of the system. After an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach toward a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with prethermalization.},

abstract = {Using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method, we numerically study the spin dynamics and transport in one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems at zero temperature. Instead of computing transport coefficients from linear-response theory, we study the real-time evolution of the magnetization start-ing from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. In particular, we are able to analyze systems far away from equilibrium with this setup. By computing the time dependence of the variance of the magnetization, we can distinguish diffusive from ballistic regimes, depending on model parameters. For the example of the aniso-tropic spin-1/2 chain and at half filling, we find the expected ballistic behavior in the easy-plane phase, while in the massive regime the dynamics of the magnetization is diffusive. Our approach allows us to tune the deviation of the initial state from the ground state and the qualitative behavior of the dynamics turns out to be valid even for highly perturbed initial states in the case of easy-plane exchange anisotropies. We further cover two examples of nonintegrable models, the frustrated chain and the two-leg spin ladder, and we encounter diffusive transport in all massive phases. In the former system, our results indicate ballistic behavior in the critical phase. We propose that the study of the time dependence of the spatial variance of particle densities could be instrumental in the characterization of the expansion of ultracold atoms in optical lattices as well.},

abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm for memory-efficient biased sampling of rare events generated by classical memoryful stochastic processes. Two efficiency metrics are used to compare quantum and classical resources for rare-event sampling. For a fixed stochastic process, the first is the classical-to-quantum ratio of required memory. We show for two example processes that there exists an infinite number of rare-event classes for which the memory ratio for sampling is larger than r, for any large real number r. Then, for a sequence of processes each labeled by an integer size N, we compare how the classical and quantum required memories scale with N. In this setting, since both memories can diverge as N → ∞, the efficiency metric tracks how fast they diverge. An extreme quantum memory advantage exists when the classical memory diverges in the limit N → ∞, but the quantum memory has a finite bound. We then show that finite-state Markov processes and spin chains exhibit memory advantage for sampling of almost all of their rare-event classes.},

Thus there is less than one-half unit of information, on average, in the smaller subsystem of a total system in a random pure state. PACS numbers: 05.30.Ch, 03.65. — w, 05.90.+m One natural way to get entropy, even for a system in a pure quantum state, is to make the coarse graining of dividing the system into subsystems and ignoring their correlations. For example, suppose a system AB with Hilbert space dimension mn and normalized density ma-trix p (a pure state p = {\~{}}Q)(g{\~{}} if p = p, which is equiv-alent to Trp = 1) is divided into two subsystems, A and B, of dimension m and n, respectively. (Without loss of generality, take the first subsystem, A, to be the one with the not larger dimension, so m (n.) The density matrix of each subsystem is obtained by the partial trace of the full density matrix p over the other subsystem, so pA = trap p{\&} = trAp. The entropy of each subsystem is (1) (2) SA = — trpA ln pA, S{\~{}} = — trp@ ln p{\~{}}. SA + Spy {\&} SAN) = — trpln p. In fact, the three entropies SA, S{\~{}}, and SA{\~{}} obey the triangle inequality [1], so if the entire system AB is in a pure state, which has SA{\~{}} — — 0, then SA — — S{\~{}}, which Unless the two systems are uncorrelated in the quantum sense (which corresponds to the case that p = p{\~{}} I3 p{\~{}}), the sum of the entropies of the subsystems, which is a coarse graining that ignores the correlations, is greater than the Bne-grained entropy SA{\~{}} of the total system: is an immediate consequence of the well-known fact that pA and p{\~{}} then have the same set of nonzero eigenvalues. It may be of interest to calculate how much entropy one typically gets by this coarse graining [2 — 5]. For example, what is the average, which I shall call S " — : (S{\~{}}), of the entropy S{\~{}} over all pure states p = [@)(Q{\~{}} of the total system? Here the average is defined with respect to the unitarily invariant Haar measure on the space of unit vectors [Q) in the mn-dimensional Hilbert space of the total system, which is proportional to the standard geo-metric hypersurface volume on the unit sphere S which those unit vectors give when the mn-complex-dimensional Hilbert space is viewed as the 2mn-real-dimensional Euclidean space [2]. Note that since S{\~{}} is a nonlinear function of the density matrix pA, the av-erage (S{\~{}}) of this entropy function is not the same as this function evaluated for the average density matrix (p{\~{}}) = I/m (the identity matrix acting on the subsystem Hilbert space, divided by its dimension m), which would be an entropy of S " =ln m, the maximum entropy the subsystem A can have. It is convenient to define the av-erage information of the subsystem as the deficit of the average entropy from the maximum, I " =— S " — (SA) = lnm — S Lubkin [2] calculated that, in my notation, 003 1-9007/93/71 (9)/1291 (4){\$}06.},

We then show that entanglement perturbations on such emergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatial curvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert space corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales as the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like the area of the boundary.

I reformulate the problem of the "interpretation of quantum mechanics" as the problem of deriving the formalism from a few simple physical postulates. I consider a reformulation of quantum mechanics in terms of information theory. All systems are assumed to be equivalent, there is no observer-observed distinction, and the theory describes only the information that systems have about each other; nevertheless, the theory is complete.},

We show that in this high-T regime, the localization transition may be studied numerically through exact diagonalization of small systems. We obtain spectra for one-dimensional lattice models of interacting spinless fermions in a random potential. As expected, the spectral statistics of finite-size samples cross over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak random potential to Poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong randomness. However, these data show deviations from simple one-parameter finite-size scaling: the apparent mobility edge " drifts " as the system's size is increased. Based on spectral statistics alone, we have thus been unable to make a strong numerical case for the presence of a many-body localized phase at nonzero T.},

abstract = {We discuss the relation between coarse-graining and the holographic principle in the framework of loop quantum gravity and ask the following question: when we coarse-grain arbitrary spin network states of quantum geometry, are we integrating out physical degrees of freedom or gauge degrees of freedom? Focusing on how bulk spin network states for bounded regions of space are projected onto boundary states, we show that all possible boundary states can be recovered from bulk spin networks with a single vertex in the bulk and a single internal loop attached to it. This partial reconstruction of the bulk from the boundary leads us to the idea of realizing the Hamiltonian constraints at the quantum level as a gauge equivalence reducing arbitrary spin network states to one-loop bulk states. This proposal of "dynamics through coarse-graining" would lead to a one-to-one map between equivalence classes of physical states under gauge transformations and boundary states, thus defining holographic dynamics for loop quantum gravity.},

@article{Farrow,
abstract = {A generic and intuitive model for coherent energy transport in multiple minima systems coupled to a quantum mechanical bath is shown. Using a simple spin-boson system, we illustrate how a generic donor-acceptor system can be brought into resonance using a narrow band of vibrational modes, such that the transfer efficiency of an electron-hole pair (exciton) is made arbitrarily high. Coherent transport phenomena in nature are of renewed interest since the discovery that a photon captured by the light-harvesting complex (LHC) in photosynthetic organisms can be conveyed to a chemical reaction centre with near-perfect efficiency. Classical explanations of the transfer use stochastic diffusion to model the hopping motion of a photo-excited exciton. This accounts inadequately for the speed and efficiency of the energy transfer measured in a series of recent landmark experiments. Taking a quantum mechanical perspective can help capture the salient features of the efficient part of that transfer. To show the versatility of the model, we extend it to a multiple minima system comprising seven-sites, reminiscent of the widely studied Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex. We show that an idealised transport model for multiple minima coupled to a narrow-band phonon can transport energy with arbitrarily high efficiency. I n this paper, we use the principle of minimum design to develop a general mechanism whereby energy can be transported with near-perfect efficiency through a generic system with multiple energy minima. Spectroscopists have been measuring wavelike electronic quantum coherences in photosynthetic light-har-vesting protein complexes 1–7 , including at the single-molecule level 8 , since 2004. The molecules capture photons from sunlight and transport their energy via photoexcited excitons to a chemical reaction center with near-perfect efficiency, unmatched by artificial systems, by computing the fastest path to the reaction centre. These observa-tions add weight to the prediction articulated by the founders of quantum physics, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr{\"{o}}dinger, that a new picture of biology would emerge when quantum theory would be applied to its study 9–12},

One of the two relations by Sagawa and Ueda is derived here in error-free quantum processes, while the other is derived only when the measurement process involves classical errors.

We show that the entanglement entropy S A of a Gaussian state grows linearly for large times in unstable systems, with a rate $\Lambda$ A ≤ h KS determined by the Lyapunov exponents and the choice of the subsystem A. We apply our results to the analysis of entanglement production in unstable quadratic potentials and due to periodic quantum quenches in many-body quantum systems. Our re-sults are relevant for quantum field theory, for which we present three applications: a scalar field in a symmetry-breaking potential, parametric resonance during post-inflationary re-heating and cosmological perturbations during inflation. Finally, we conjecture that the same rate $\Lambda$ A appears in the entanglement growth of chaotic quantum systems prepared in a semiclassical state.},

Jarzynski equality, Crooks fluctuation theorem, and the FTs of heat as well as the trajectory entropy production can be regarded as special cases of this refined unified FT, and all of them are generalized to arbitrary initial distributions. We also find that the refined unified FT can easily reproduce the FTs for processes with the feedback control, due to its unconventional structure that separates the thermodynamic variable from the choices of initial distributions. Our result is heuristic for further understanding of the relations and distinctions between all kinds of FTs and might be valuable for studying thermodynamic processes with information exchange.},

However, its relationships to fundamental limits of computation, such as Landauer's limit, remain unknown. Here we show that in order to increase transfer entropy (predictability) by one bit, heat flow must match or exceed Landauer's limit. Importantly, we generalise Landauer's limit to bi-directional information dynamics for non-equilibrium processes, revealing that the limit applies to prediction, in addition to retrodiction (information erasure). Furthermore, the results are related to negentropy, and to Bremermann's limit and the Bekenstein bound, producing, perhaps surprisingly, lower bounds on the computational deceleration and information loss incurred during an increase in predictability about the process. The identified relationships set new computational limits in terms of fundamental physical quantities, and establish transfer entropy as a central measure connecting information theory, thermodynamics and theory of computation.},

As a specific example, we study the exact holographic mapping for {\$}(1+1){\$}-dimensional lattice Dirac fermions and explore the emergent bulk geometry corresponding to different boundary states including massless and massive states at zero temperature, and the massless system at finite temperature. We also study two entangled one-dimensional chains and show that the corresponding bulk geometry consists of two asymptotic regions connected by a worm-hole. The quantum quench of the coupled chains is mapped to dynamics of the worm-hole.

abstract = {Building on recent significant results of Frodden, Ghosh and Perez (FGP) and Bianchi, I present a quantum version of Jacobson's argument that the Einstein equations emerge as the equation of state of a quantum gravitational system. I give three criteria a quantum theory of gravity must satisfy if it is to allow Jacobson's argument to be run. I then show that the results of FGP and Bianchi provide evidence that loop quantum gravity satisfies two of these criteria and argue that the third should also be satisfied in loop quantum gravity. I also show that the energy defined by FGP is the canonical energy associated with the boundary term of the Holst action.},

abstract = {We examine the consequences of classical ergodicity for the localization properties of individual quantum eigenstates in the classical limit. We note that the well-known Schnirelman result is a weaker form of quantum ergodicity than the one implied by random matrix theory. This suggests the possibility of systems with non-gaussian random eigenstates which are nonetheless ergodic in the sense of Schnirelman and lead to ergodic transport in the classical limit. These we call "weakly quantum ergodic". Indeed for a class of "slow ergodic" classical systems, it is found that each eigenstate becomes localized to an ever decreasing fraction of the available state space, in the semiclassical limit. Nevertheless, each eigenstate in this limit covers phase space evenly on any classical scale, and long-time transport properties between individual quantum states remain ergodic due to the diffractive effects which dominate quantum phase space exploration.},

abstract = {In the holographic correspondence of quantum gravity, a global onsite symmetry at the boundary generally translates to a local gauge symmetry in the bulk. In this paper, we extend the tensor network based toy model for holography introduced in [arXiv:1701.04778] to incorporate this feature. We lift the multi-scale renormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of the ground state of a one dimensional (1D) local Hamiltonian, which has a global onsite symmetry, to a dual quantum state of a 2D lattice on which the symmetry appears gauged. We show how the 2D bulk state decomposes in terms of spin network states, which label a basis in the gauge-invariant sector of the bulk lattice. This decomposition is instrumental to obtain expectation values of gauge-invariant observables in the bulk, and also reveals that the bulk state is generally entangled between the gauge and the remaining bulk degrees of freedom that are not fixed by the symmetry. (In analogy with the holographic correspondence, we interpret the latter to possibly include "gravitational" degrees of freedom.) We illustrate these features for a particular subset of bulk states referred to as copy bulk states. We present numerical results for ground states of several 1D critical spin chains to illustrate that: (i) entanglement in the dual copy bulk states potentially depends on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theories, and (ii) the spectrum of a bulk density matrix, obtained by tracing out the gauge degrees of freedom, exhibits degeneracies, possibly suggesting an emergent symmetry in the non-gauge sector of the bulk. We also illustrate the possibility of emergent topological order in the bulk. More broadly, our holographic model translates the MERA, a tensor network state, to a superposition of spin network states, as they appear in lattice gauge theories in one higher dimension.},

abstract = {Entanglement and entropy are key concepts standing at the foundations of quantum and statistical mechanics, respectively. In the last decade the study of quantum quenches revealed that these two concepts are intricately intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial state maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the quench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble with non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the post-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated quantum systems. An exact computation of the entanglement dynamics has been provided only for non-interacting systems, and it was believed to be unfeasible for genuinely interacting models. Conversely, here we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the asymptotic state, leads to a complete analytical understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space-time scaling limit. Our framework requires only knowledge about the steady state, and the velocities of the low-lying excitations around it. We provide a thorough check of our result focusing on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain, and considering quenches from several initial states. We compare our results with numerical simulations using both tDMRG and iTEBD, finding always perfect agreement.},

Extending the induced gravity action on the brane to include the curvature-squared interactions, we show that the Wald entropy closely matches the expression describing the entanglement entropy. The difference is that for a general region, the latter includes terms involving the extrinsic curvature of the entangling surface, which do not appear in the Wald entropy.

abstract = {It has previously been suggested that small subsystems of closed quantum systems thermalize under some assumptions; however, this has been rigorously shown so far only for systems with very weak interaction between subsystems. In this work, we give rigorous analytic results on thermalization for translation-invariant quantum lattice systems with finite-range interaction of arbitrary strength, in all cases where there is a unique equilibrium state at the corresponding temperature. We clarify the physical picture by showing that subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the local Gibbs state, if the initial state has close to maximal population entropy and certain non-degeneracy conditions on the spectrum are satisfied. Moreover, we show that almost all pure states with support on a small energy window are locally thermal in the sense of canonical typicality. We derive our results from a statement on equivalence of ensembles, generalizing earlier results by Lima, and give numerical and analytic finite-size bounds, relating the Ising model to the finite de Finetti theorem. Furthermore, we prove that global energy eigenstates are locally close to diagonal in the local energy eigenbasis, which constitutes a part of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis that is valid regardless of the integrability of the model.},

@article{Turner2018,
abstract = {C ontrollable, quantum-coherent systems of ultracold atoms 1,2 , trapped ions 3 and nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond 4 have emerged as platforms for realizing and probing highly non-equilibrium quantum matter. In particular, these systems have opened the door to the investigation of non-ergodic dynamics in isolated quantum systems. Such an unusual kind of dynamics is now known to occur when there is an emergence of many conserved quantities, such as in integrable systems 5 and many-body localiza-tion 6-8. In both cases, the system strongly violates the 'eigenstate thermalization hypothesis' (ETH) 9,10 , which was conjectured to govern the properties of ergodic systems and their approach to thermal equilibrium. This motivates the question: are there systems that only weakly break ergodicity? In particular, are there systems in which some eigenstates are atypical and dynamics strongly depends on the initial conditions? The existing theoretical studies, which tested the ETH numerically in systems of spins, fermions and bosons in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems 11,12 seem to rule out such a possibility. In particular, an earlier study 13 found that in an ergodic spin chain, all highly excited states were typical and thermal, obeying the strong version of the ETH. In this paper we demonstrate that weak breaking of ergodicity can occur in kinetically constrained 1D models that are reminiscent of the effective models describing the interactions between anyon excitations in 2D topological phases of matter, such as fractional quantum Hall states 14. Topological order in these systems is connected with emergent gauge fields, such that their many-body Hilbert space cannot be decomposed as a tensor product of local Hilbert spaces. Although models of this type have been theoretically investigated 15-22 , recent works 23-25 demonstrate that they can also be realized in experiments with Rydberg atoms in 1D or 2D traps. We focus on the simple example of a 1D chain (with the Hamiltonian defined in equation (1) below) whose constrained Hilbert space grows in the Fibonacci sequence, and therefore below we refer to this system as a 'Fibonacci chain'. Our results for the non-ergodic dynamics in the Fibonacci chain can be summarized as follows. First, based on the energy level statistics , we find that the model exhibits level repulsion and is non-integrable. Second, we show that the model has a band of special eigenstates coexisting with thermalizing eigenstates in the middle of the many-body band. Surprisingly, even though the special eigenstates comprise only a vanishing fraction of all states in the thermodynamic limit, they have direct physical manifestations, and they can be accessed by preparing the system in specific product states. In particular, the band of special eigenstates underlies the unexpected long-duration oscillations observed experimentally 25. Finally, we shed light on the structure of special eigenstates by introducing an effective tight-binding model. This allows us to obtain accurate numerical approximations of special eigenstates by solving the problem of a single particle hopping on a Hilbert space graph. The existence of a band of special eigenstates is strongly reminiscent of the phenomenon of quantum scars in single-particle chaotic billiards 26 , which have been observed in microwave cavities 27 and quantum dots 28. In the context of single-particle quantum chaos, scars represent a concentration of some eigenfunctions along the trajectory of unstable classical periodic orbits. In our study of a many-body system, strong revivals arise due to the existence of an analogous trajectory in the Hilbert space that includes two particular product states. We show that this periodic orbit 'scars' a subset of eigenstates that form a special band. Analogous to the single-particle case, these eigenstates are concentrated in parts of the Hilbert space. Our effective tight-binding approach sheds light on the structure of scarred eigenstates and, correspondingly, the structure of the periodic orbit. Model In the experiment 25 , a chain of Rydberg atoms was realized in which, effectively, excitations were created/annihilated with equal amplitudes. In the limit where the nearest-neighbour interaction is much The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergo-dicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.

abstract = {The resource theory of asymmetry is a framework for classifying and quantifying the symmetry-breaking properties of both states and operations relative to a given symmetry. In the special case where the symmetry is the set of translations generated by a fixed observable, asymmetry can be interpreted as coherence relative to the observable eigenbasis, and the resource theory of asymmetry provides a framework to study this notion of coherence. We here show that this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed limits. Indeed, the very concept of speed of evolution, i.e., the inverse of the minimum time it takes the system to evolve to another (partially) distinguishable state, is a measure of asymmetry relative to the time translations generated by the system Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the celebrated Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin speed limits can be interpreted as upper bounds on this measure of asymmetry by functions which are themselves measures of asymmetry in the special case of pure states. Using measures of asymmetry that are not restricted to pure states, such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information, we obtain extensions of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound which are significantly tighter in the case of mixed states. We also clarify some confusions in the literature about coherence and asymmetry, and show that measures of coherence are a proper subset of measures of asymmetry.},

Abstract The notion of thermal time has been introduced as a possible basis for a fully general-relativistic thermodynamics. Here we study this notion in the restricted context of stationary spacetimes. We show that the Tolman–Ehrenfest effect (in a stationary gravitational field, temperature is not constant in space at thermal equilibrium) can be derived very simply by applying the equivalence principle to a key property of thermal time; at equilibrium, temperature is the rate of thermal time with respect to proper time—the 'speed of (thermal) time'. Unlike other published derivations of the Tolman–Ehrenfest relation, this one is free from any further dynamical assumption, thereby illustrating the physical import of the notion of thermal time.},

abstract = {This is a review of the problem of Mutually Unbiased Bases in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, real and complex. Also a geometric measure of " mubness " is introduced, and applied to some explicit calculations in six dimensions (partly done by Bj{\"{o}}rck and by Grassl). Although this does not yet solve any problem, some appealing structures emerge. A formula that has been of central importance in many discussions about the foundations of quantum mechanics is ||x|p| 2 = constant . (1) It expresses the complementarity of position and momentum. If we know everything about position, we know nothing of momentum. In Hilbert spaces of finite dimension N, the analogous equation would concern two orthonormal bases |e a and | f a such that ||e a | f b | 2 = constant = 1 N , 0 ≤ a, b ≤ N − 1 . (2) The important thing is that the right hand side is independent of a and b. If such bases can be found, they are said to be mutually unbiased bases, or MUBs for short. The name emphasises that the information obtained in a projective measurement associated to one of the bases is completely unrelated to the information obtained from a projective mea-surement associated to the other. The question is: how many MUBs can one introduce in a given Hilbert space? If N is a power of a prime number then one can find N + 1 MUBs [1] [2], but for other values of N the number might be smaller. On the other hand it might not: I simply do not know. Why should you care about this problem? Apart from the fact that it is easy to state, several answers can be given. One answer is that MUBs are useful in quantum state tomography [3, 4]. Another has to do with various cryptographic protocols [5]. Thus, whether one wants to find or hide information, unbiasedness is a useful property. A third answer is that when one begins to look into it, the MUB problem leads one into many corners of mathematics that have been explored in communication theory, computer science, and so on, but which are relatively unknown to quantum physicists. If the essence of quantum mechanics is that it permits one to do things that cannot be done in a classical world, then many surprises may be lurking in those corners.},

abstract = {In the Jacobson formalism general relativity is obtained from thermodynamics. This is done by using the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy–area relation. However, as a black hole gets smaller, its temperature will increase. This will cause the thermal fluctuations to also increase, and these will in turn correct the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy–area relation. Furthermore, with the reduction in the size of the black hole, quantum effects will also start to dominate. Just as the general relativity can be obtained from thermodynam-ics in the Jacobson formalism, we propose that the quantum fluctuations to the geometry can be obtained from thermal fluctuations.},

@article{Evans2002,
abstract = {The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical ¯uctuations in thermostatted dissipa-tive non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energthermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermo-dynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quanti{\textregistered}es the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observa-tion that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reverseanti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been con{\textregistered}rmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simula-tion and very recently in laboratory experiments.},

From this starting point we follow the approach that uses a reduced basis of many-body states. Together with an extrapolation to the full basis, it proves to be efficient for the evaluation of the stiffnesses of local observables, which remain finite within the nonergodic regime and represent the hallmark of the many-body localization (MBL). The method enables a larger span of system sizes and, within the MBL regime, allows for a more careful analysis of the size scaling of calculated quantities. On the other hand, the survival stiffness as the representative of nonlocal quantities, reveals limitations of the reduced-basis approach.},

Recent experimental and theoretical developments give clear evidence of the dominant role chaotic dynamics plays not only in local level statistics, but also in the damping of collective motion, isospin and parity nonconservation, thermal-ization, and decay into continuum. In this review, those and other phenomena are discussed from the general viewpoint of quantum chaos and complexity. The complexity of eigenstates measured by information entropy in the mean-field basis is more informative than the standard signatures of chaos in the level statistics. It evolves regularly as a function of excitation energy and provides an alternative temperature scale. This sheds new light on the problems of foundations of statistical mechanics and quantum decoherence.},

@article{Gingrich2016,
abstract = {Near equilibrium, small current fluctuations are described by a Gaussian distribution with a linear-response variance regulated by the dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that dissipation still plays a dominant role in structuring large fluctuations arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In particular, we prove a linear-response-like bound on the large deviation function for currents in Markov jump processes. We find that nonequilibrium current fluctuations are always more likely than what is expected from a linear-response analysis. As a small-fluctuations corollary, we derive a recently conjectured uncertainty bound on the variance of current fluctuations. One of the most useful insights into thermodynamics has been that fluctuations near equilibrium are completely characterized by just one principle: the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [1]. Far from equilibrium, however, fluctuations exhibit less universal structure. As such, characterizing the rich anatomy of nonequilibrium fluctuations has been handled on a case by case basis, with few universal nonequilibrium principles. Notable exceptions are the fluctuation theorems [2-7], as well as fluctuation-dissipation theorems for nonequilibrium steady states [8-12]. Recently, Barato and Seifert have proposed a new kind of nonequilibrium principle, a thermodynamic uncertainty relation that expresses a trade-off between the variance of current fluctuations and the rate of entropy production [13]. It reveals that away from equilibrium, dissipation continues to regulate small fluctuations. While the thermodynamic uncertainty relation was not proven in general, analytical calculations and numerical evidence support its validity [13]. Applications appear myriad, and already include insights into chemical kinetics as well as biochemical sensing [14,15]. In this Letter, we demonstrate that dissipation in fact constrains all current fluctuations. In particular, we prove a pair of general thermodynamic inequalities for the large deviation function of the steady-state empirical currents in Markov jump processes. Such processes model a variety of scenarios, including molecular motors [16], chemical reaction networks [17,18], and mesoscopic quantum devices [19]. Our analysis reveals that far from equilibrium, current fluctuations are always more probable than would be predicted by linear response [20,21]. Remarkably, our relationship bounds even rare fluctuations (large deviations), and by specializing to small deviations we obtain the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We have in mind a system with N mesoscopic states (or configurations), x ¼ 1; {\ldots}; N. Transitions between pairs of states, say from y to z, are modeled as a continuous-time Markov jump process with rates rðy; zÞ [22]. It is convenient to picture these dynamics occurring on a graph (as in Fig. 1), with vertices denoting states and edges (or links) symbolizing possible transitions. We assume the dynamics to be ergodic and that rðz; yÞ {\textgreater} 0 whenever rðy; zÞ {\textgreater} 0, so the system's probability density relaxes to a unique steady state $\pi$ðxÞ in the long-time limit. Thermodynamics enters by requiring the transitions to satisfy local detailed balance; the ratio of rates on each edge can then be identified with a generalized thermodynamic force Fðy; zÞ ¼ ln $\pi$ðyÞrðy; zÞ $\pi$ðzÞrðz; yÞ ; ð1Þ which quantifies the dissipation in each transition [23]. For example, if a transition were mediated by a thermal reservoir at inverse temperature $\beta$, we have F ¼ $\Delta$s þ $\beta$q, where $\Delta$s ¼ − ln½$\pi$ðzÞ=$\pi$ðyÞ is the change in the system's stochastic entropy [24] and $\beta$q ¼ ln½rðy; zÞ=rðz; yÞ is the FIG. 1. Current fluctuations illustration: for a four-state model (inset) in a nonequilibrium steady state, the integrated current J T-the net number of hops between pairs of states-along each edge is plotted as a function of time. Each integrated current displays an average rate perturbed by stochastic fluctuations.},

The set of all holographic entropy inequali-ties bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces.

We investigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the replica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct geometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expecta-tion value of the area operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the number of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the central charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the choice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density matrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the homology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology constraint is not a linear property in the CFT. We also discuss the existence of 'entropy operators' in general systems with a large number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {We explore the constraints following from requiring the area law in the entanglement entropy in the context of loop quantum gravity. We find a unique solution to the single-link wave function in the large j limit, believed to be appropriate in the semiclassical limit. We then generalize our considerations to multilink coherent states, and find that the area law is preserved very generically using our single-link wave function as a building block. Finally, we develop the framework that generates families of multilink states that preserve the area law while avoiding macroscopic entanglement, the space-time analogue of " Schr{\"{o}}dinger's cat. " We note that these states, defined on a given set of graphs, are the ground states of some local Hamiltonian that can be constructed explicitly. This can potentially shed light on the construction of the appropriate Hamiltonian constraints in the LQG framework.},

abstract = {Fullerene single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) were produced in yields of more than 70 percent by condensation of a laser-vaporized carbon-nickel-cobalt mixture at 1200degreesC. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy showed that these SWNTs are nearly uniform in diameter and that they self-organize into "ropes," which consist of 100 to 500 SWNTs in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 17 angstroms. The x-ray form factor is consistent with that of uniformly charged cylinders 13.8 +/- 0.2 angstroms in diameter. The ropes were metallic, with a single-rope resistivity of {\textless}10(-4) ohm-centimeters at 300 kelvin. The uniformity of SWNT diameter is attributed to the efficient annealing of an initial fullerene tubelet kept open by a few metal atoms; the optimum diameter is determined by competition between the strain energy of curvature of the graphene sheet and the dangling-bond energy of the open edge, where growth occurs. These factors strongly favor the metallic (10,10) tube with C5v symmetry and an open edge stabilized by triple bonds.},

abstract = {We examine how to construct a spatial manifold and its geometry from the entanglement structure of an abstract quantum state in Hilbert space. Given a decomposition of Hilbert space H into a tensor product of factors, we consider a class of " redundancy-constrained states " in H that generalize the area-law behavior for entanglement entropy usually found in condensed-matter systems with gapped local Hamiltonians. Using mutual information to define a distance measure on the graph, we employ classical multidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit spatial dimensionality of the emergent geometry. We then show that entanglement perturbations on such emergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatial curvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert space corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales as the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like the area of the boundary. A version of the ER ¼ EPR conjecture is recovered, in that perturbations that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry generate a configuration that may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole.},

@article{Alonso2016,
abstract = {We consider continuously monitored quantum systems and introduce definitions of work and heat along individual quantum trajectories that are valid for coherent superposition of energy eigenstates. We use these quantities to extend the first and second laws of stochastic thermodynamics to the quantum domain. We illustrate our results with the case of a weakly measured driven two-level system and show how to distinguish between quantum work and heat contributions. We finally employ quantum feedback control to suppress detector backaction and determine the work statistics. Thermodynamics is, at its heart, a theory of work and heat. The first law is based on the realization that both quantities are two forms of energy and that their sum is conserved. At the same time, the fact that entropy, defined as the ratio of reversible heat and temperature, can only increase in an isolated system is an expression of the second law [1,2]. In classical thermodynamics, work is defined as the change of internal energy in an isolated system, W ¼ $\Delta$U, while heat is introduced as the difference, Q ¼ $\Delta$U − W, in a nonisolated system. Thermal isolation is thus crucial to distinguish W from Q. In the last decades, stochastic thermodynamics has successfully extended the definitions of work and heat to the level of single trajectories of microscopic systems [3]. In this regime, thermal fluctuations are no longer negligible and the laws of thermodynamics have to be adapted to fully include them. The second law has, for instance, been generalized in the form of fluctuation theorems that quantify the occurrence of negative entropy production [4]. A particular example is the Jarzynski equality, hexpð−$\beta$WÞi ¼ expð−$\beta$$\Delta$FÞ, which allows the determination of equilibrium free energy differences $\Delta$F from the nonequilibrium work statistics in systems at initial inverse temperature $\beta$ [5]. The laws of stochastic thermodynamics have been verified in a large number of different experiments; see Refs. [6,7] and the review [8]. The current challenge is to extend the principles of thermodynamics to include quantum effects which are expected to dominate at smaller scales and colder temperatures. Some of the unsolved key issues concern the correct definition of quantum work and heat, means to distinguish between the two quantities owing to the blurring effect of quantum fluctuations, and the proper clarification of the role of quantum coherence. A variety of approaches have been suggested to tackle these problems [9-20], and quantum work statistics has been measured in isolated systems in two pioneering experiments using NMR [21] and trapped ions [22]. A new approach may emerge from the possibility of weakly monitoring quantum systems. Recently, individual quantum trajectories of a supercon-ducting qubit in a microwave cavity have been observed using weak measurements [23,24]. These measurements only slightly disturb quantum systems owing to the weak coupling to the measuring device [25]. They hence allow us to gain information about states without projecting them into eigenstates. They have been successfully employed to explain quantum paradoxes [26], detect and amplify weak signals [27,28], determine a quantum virtual state [29], and directly measure a wave function [30]. Motivated by the two experiments [23,24], we here investigate the first and second law for continuously monitored quantum systems and aim at developing a quantum stochastic thermody-namics based on quantum trajectories. Such an extension faces several technical difficulties. First, since a weakly measured system can be in a coherent superposition of energy eigenstates, energy is not a well-defined concept along a single quantum trajectory. Furthermore, even in the absence of an external environment, a continuously monitored quantum system is not isolated and the detector backaction, albeit small, will perturb its dynamics [25]. As a result, its time evolution will be nonunitary and energy, in the form of heat, will be exchanged with the detector. In the following, we introduce suitable and consistent definitions of work and heat contributions to the quantum stochastic evolution of a weakly measured system that is externally driven. We use these definitions to determine the distributions of quantum work and heat for a two-level system, and to demonstrate the general validity of the Jarzynski equality, hence of the second law. We finally use the tools of quantum feedback control [31] to suppress detector backaction and thus effectively achieve thermal isolation of the system. This provides a practical scheme to experimentally test our definitions of work and heat along individual quantum trajectories.

abstract = {We study bipartite entanglement entropies in the ground and excited states of free-fermion models, where a staggered potential, $\mu$ s , induces a gap in the spectrum. Ground-state entanglement entropies satisfy the " area law " , and the " area-law " coefficient is found to diverge as a logarithm of the staggered potential, when the system has an extended Fermi surface at $\mu$ s = 0. On the square lattice, we show that the coefficient of the logarithmic divergence depends on the Fermi surface geometry and its orientation with respect to the real-space interface between subsystems and is related to the Widom conjecture as enunciated by Gioev and Klich [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 100503 (2006)]. For point Fermi surfaces in two-dimension, the " area-law " coefficient stays finite as $\mu$ s → 0. The von Neumann entanglement entropy associated with the excited states follows a " volume law " and allows us to calculate an entropy density function s V (e), which is substantially different from the thermodynamic entropy density function s T (e), when the lattice is bipartitioned into two equal subsystems but approaches the thermodynamic entropy density as the fraction of sites in the larger subsystem, that is integrated out, approaches unity.},

abstract = {Chaos and ergodicity are the cornerstones of statistical physics and thermodynamics. Although classically, even small systems such as a particle in a two-dimensional cavity can exhibit chaotic behavior and thereby relax to a microcanonical ensemble, quantum systems formally cannot. However, recent theoretical work and, in particular, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), indicate that quantum systems can also thermalize. Indeed, ETH provides a framework connecting microscopic models and macroscopic phenomena, based on the notion of highly entangled quantum states. On page 794 of this issue, Kaufman et al. ( 1 ) demonstrate such thermalization in the relaxation dynamics of a small lattice system of interacting bosonic particles. By directly measuring the entanglement entropy of subsystems, as well as other observables, they show that after the initial transient time, the system locally relaxes to a thermal ensemble while globally maintaining a zero-entropy pure state.},

Temperature uniformity is often derived from the maximization of the total number of microstates of two interacting systems under energy exchanges. Here we discuss a generalized version of this derivation, based on informational notions, which remains valid in the general context. The result is based on the observation that the time taken by any system to move to a distinguishable (nearly orthogonal) quantum state is a universal quantity that depends solely on the temperature. At equilibrium the net information flow between two systems must vanish, and this happens when two systems transit the same number of distinguishable states in the course of their interaction.},

abstract = {The relationship between thermodynamics and statistical physics is valid in the thermo-dynamic limit-when the number of particles becomes very large. Here we study thermo-dynamics in the opposite regime-at both the nanoscale and when quantum effects become important. Applying results from quantum information theory, we construct a theory of thermodynamics in these limits. We derive general criteria for thermodynamical state transitions , and, as special cases, find two free energies: one that quantifies the deterministically extractable work from a small system in contact with a heat bath, and the other that quantifies the reverse process. We find that there are fundamental limitations on work extraction from non-equilibrium states, owing to finite size effects and quantum coherences. This implies that thermodynamical transitions are generically irreversible at this scale. As one application of these methods, we analyse the efficiency of small heat engines and find that they are irreversible during the adiabatic stages of the cycle.},

abstract = {It is shown that quantum fluctuation theorems remain unaffected if measurements of any kind and number of observables are performed during the action of a force protocol. That is, although the backward and forward probabilities entering the fluctuation theorems are both altered by these measurements, their ratio remains unchanged. This observation allows us to describe the measurement of fluxes through interfaces and, in this way, to bridge the gap between the current theory, based on only two measurements performed at the beginning and end of the protocol, and experiments that are based on continuous monitoring. In the last decade fluctuation theorems have experienced renewed and widespread interest [1-6]. These theorems yield rigorous predictions for nonequilibrium processes beyond linear response theory. In particular, they quantify the probability of events that are forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics as being exponentially suppressed compared to the probability of a typical, allowed event. While experimental verifications of the fluctuation theorems for classical systems were performed by different groups and for different systems, e.g., [7-9], an experiment with quantum devices was performed only very recently [10]. In that experiment the flow of electrons through a double quantum dot placed between two leads with different chemical potentials was continuously monitored and the quantum fluctuation theorem was verified for the probability pðqÞ that a number q of electrons is exchanged by the leads in a certain interval of time ¼ t f {\`{A}} t 0 ; see Fig. 1. With regard to theory, however, the existing derivations of fluctuation theorems for quantum transport do not allow for a continuous monitoring of the flux of energy and/or particles. They are rather based on two projective quantum measurements of the relevant observables (Ham-iltonian, number of particles), performed at t 0 and t f , where the exchanged energy and number of particles are obtained as differences of the outcomes of these two measurements [5,11-13]. Evidently, this scheme presents practical difficulties, as it is not clear, for example, how one could measure the macroscopically large number of electrons in a lead with the required single electron resolution. Therefore, as other authors also have pointed out (see the conclusions in Ref. [12]), it is necessary to bridge the gap between theory and experiment by extending the theory in such a way as to account for the possibility of continuously monitoring a specific quantum observable of the system. In this Letter we develop a multiple measurement approach to quantum fluctuation theorems that extends the previous two-measurement fluctuation theorems [5,11-13] allowing for the possibility to perform measurements of any observable within the interval (t 0 , t f). Most importantly, we demonstrate how to use this approach to overcome the major problem of measuring total energies and particle numbers of large reservoirs in case of a transport problem as the one described in Ref. [10]. The salient point here is to consider the fluxes through an interface rather than absolute numbers of particles and amounts of energy. This provides a coherent and general theoretical framework within which the recently reported electron transport experiment of Ref. [10] can be properly analyzed and understood, and new experiments can possibly be devised. Multiple measurements scheme.-We consider a quantum system composed of subsystems, whose mutual interaction is turned on only within the finite time interval (t 0 , t f). They are initially disconnected and separately in equilibrium at different temperatures and chemical potentials. On coupling them through a time-dependent interaction leads to energy and particle transfers. While this exchange of energy and particles occurs a quantum observable is monitored, as in the experiment reported in [10]; see Fig. 1. FIG. 1 (color online). Schematic representation of a bidirec-tional counting statistics experiment. Two leads (large semicircles) with different electronic chemical potentials (1 Þ 2) and same inverse temperature (1 ¼ 2) are connected through a double quantum dot (small circles), whose quantum state is continuously monitored. The state (1,0), i.e., ''one electron in the left dot, no electrons in the right dot'' is depicted. The transition from this state to the state (0,1) signals the exchange of one electron from subsystem 1 to subsystem 2. H 1;2 and N 1;2 denote the Hamiltonian and number of electrons operators of each subsystem, respectively.},

abstract = {We study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy of a one-dimensional nonintegrable spin chain, starting from random nonentangled initial pure states. We use exact diagonalization of a non-integrable quantum Ising chain with transverse and longitudinal fields to obtain the exact quantum dynamics. We show that the entanglement entropy increases linearly with time before finite-size saturation begins, demonstrating a ballistic spreading of the entanglement, while the energy transport in the same system is diffusive. Thus, we explicitly demonstrate that the spreading of entanglement is much faster than the energy diffusion in this nonintegrable system. Entanglement is one of the unique features of quantum mechanics that does not exist in classical physics. Originally, quantum entanglement was viewed with some skepticism [1,2], but recently, the study of entanglement has become a central part of many-body quantum physics and quantum information science. Despite impressive recent progress in understanding entanglement from various viewpoints, many of its aspects remain to be further explored. One natural question about entanglement is its quantum dynamics under unitary time evolution. If one starts an isolated quantum system in a nonentangled initial product pure state, how does the entanglement grow with time? Entanglement is not a conserved quantity like energy, that is transported. Instead, it is more like an infection or epidemic [3] that multiplies and spreads. An initial state that is a product state has the information about the initial state of each local degree of freedom (spins in our model below) initially localized on that degree of freedom. Under the system's unitary time evolution, quantum information about each spin's initial state can spread with time to other spins, due to the spin-spin interactions. This can make those spins that share this information entangled. In real physical systems, information and entanglement can spread as fast as the speed of light (or sound). For a lattice spin model, which lacks propagating light or sound, an upper limit on the speed of any information spread is given by the Lieb-Robinson bound, which is set by the spin-spin interactions [4] (for recent reviews, see Refs. [5,6]). For integrable one-dimensional models, the entanglement does indeed spread ballistically [7-9], which is to be expected since such systems have ballistically propagating quasiparticles that can serve as carriers of the information. For various localized models, on the other hand, the entanglement has been shown to spread much more slowly, only logarithmically with time [8,10-16]. In the present Letter, we consider an intermediate case, a quantum Ising spin chain that is neither integrable nor localized, whose energy transport is diffusive. Here, we investigate the spread of entanglement in a diffusive nonintegrable system, at high temperature where there are no ballistically propagating quasiparticles and the only conserved quantity is the energy which moves diffu-sively [17]. Diagonalizing the entire Hamiltonian matrix, we numerically study the time evolution of the entangle-ment and the diffusive dynamics of energy transport for highly excited thermal states of the system. We show that the entanglement spreads ballistically, while the energy moves only diffusively and thus slowly. Although we choose a specific model Hamiltonian to study the quantum dynamics, this result should be valid generally for non-localized and nonintegrable systems that do not have ballistically propagating quasiparticles or long-wavelength propagating modes such as light or acoustic sound. As a simple nonintegrable model Hamiltonian, we choose a spin-1=2 Ising chain with both transverse and longitudinal fields. The model is translationally invariant, except at the ends of the chain, which we leave open. Leaving the ends open allows the longest distance within the chain to be its full length, so we can study energy transport over that distance and the spread of bipartite entanglement from the center of the chain to its ends. If we had used periodic boundary conditions instead, the longest distances that we could study would be cut in half. Given the limited lengths that one can study with exact diagonalization, this factor of 2 is quite important. Our Hamiltonian is H ¼ X L i¼1},

We clarify the relevant Hilbert space from which the pure states are to be sampled, and construct practically all the typical pure NESSs. The scattering approach leads us to the natural extension of the typicality for equilibrium systems. Each pure NESS correctly yields the expectation values of observables given by the standard ensemble approach. It means that we can calculate the expectation values in a NESS with only a single pure NESS. We provide an explicit construction of the typical pure NESS for a model with two reservoirs, and see that it correctly reproduces the Landauer-type formula for the current flowing steadily between the reservoirs.},

abstract = {calculated from Kasuya's formula, for the most pure samples above 3. 0'K and the dependence of Ho and Jo/Ao on carrier concentration, are under investigation. We wish to acknowledge the technica, l assis-tance provided by Mr. C. D. Wilson. We thank Mr. M. P. Mathur for providing Ge (grown by Miss L. Roth) which he found suitable for low-temperature thermometers, and Professor H. Yearian for x-ray orientations of the samples. It is the purpose of this note to point out a new mechanism which provides an instability against Cooper-pair formation. We find that a weakly interacting system of fermions can-not remain normal down to the absolute zero of temperature, no matter what the form of the interaction. This mechanism has nothing to do with the conventional electron-phonon attractive interaction in metals, or the long-range attractive van der Waals forces in He'. It is present even in the case of purely repul-sive forces between the particles, and is due to the sharpness of the Fermi surface for the normal system. To understand what is involved, we first take an over-simplified view of the effect. It has long been known' that if a charge is placed in a metal, the screening is such that there re-mains a long-range oscillatory potential of the form cos(2kFr+ q)/r{\~{}} (kF is the Fermi mo mentum). This leads to a long-range interac-tion between charges. Formally, the source of this long-range force is the singularity of the dielectric constant as a function of the mo-mentum transfer q, when q=2kF. ' This sin-gularity in the Fourier transform of the inter-action gives rise to a long-ranged oscillatory force in ordinary space. All that is necessary for this effect is a sharp Fermi surface; a rounding of the Fermi surface due to (say) finite temperature or impurities will give rise to an interaction which drops off exponential-ly at very large distances. It is plausible to suppose that, similarly, the effective interaction between the fermions themselves will have a long-range oscillatory part. By taking advantage of the attractive regions, Cooper pairs can form thus giving rise to superconductivity. To investigate this possibility more system-atically we consider the following model: an isotropic system of spin-—, ' fermions with weak short-range forces between them. The crite-rion we use for the onset of superconductivity is that the scattering amplitude for pairs of quasiparticles of equal and opposite momenta 524},

Significantly off equilibrium, the linear response is expected to break down and even a description in terms of canonical ensembles is questionable. We unveil that single pure states with density profiles of maximum amplitude yield a broadening in perfect agreement with the linear response, if the structure of these states involves randomness in terms of decoherent off-diagonal density-matrix elements.

Each vertex of the graph represents a generic interaction between subsystems, described by a random unitary matrix distributed according to the Haar measure, while each edge of the graph represents a bipartite, maximally entangled state. For any splitting of the graph into two parts we consider the corresponding partition of the quantum system and compute the average entropy of entanglement. First, in the special case where the partition does not cross any vertex of the graph, we show that the area law is satisfied exactly. In the general case, we show that the entropy of entanglement obeys an area law on average, this time with a correction term that depends on the topologies of the graph and of the partition. The results obtained are applied to the problem of distribution of quantum entanglement in a quantum network with prescribed topology.

abstract = {Work and quantum correlations are two fundamental resources in thermodynamics and quantum information theory. In this work we study how to use correlations among quantum systems to optimally store work. We analyse this question for isolated quantum ensembles, where the work can be naturally divided into two contributions: a local contribution from each system, and a global contribution originating from correlations among systems. We focus on the latter and consider quantum systems which are locally thermal, thus from which any extractable work can only come from correlations. We compute the maximum extractable work for general entangled states, separable states, and states with fixed entropy. Our results show that while entanglement gives an advantage for small quantum ensembles, this gain vanishes for a large number of systems.},

Quantum coherence in many-body systems embodies the essence of entanglement and is an essential ingredient for a plethora of physical phenomena in quantum optics, quantum information, solid state physics, and nanoscale thermodynamics. In recent years, research on the presence and functional role of quantum coherence in biological systems has also attracted considerable interest. Despite the fundamental importance of quantum coherence, the development of a rigorous theory of quantum coherence as a physical resource has been initiated only recently.

abstract = {The Jarzynski equality and the Crooks fluctuation theorem enable the calculation of the change in a system's free energy from nonequilibrium path integrals. These relations consider processes where the system is driven out of equilibrium by a mechanical external agent while remaining in contact with a thermal reservoir at a fixed temperature. We generalize these relations to describe processes driven by any type of external agent, be it thermal or mechanical. Attention is given to the case of a system, initially in equilibrium, that is driven through a temperature change by a heat reservoir. The results are cast in a form applicable to experiments. The Jarzynski equality (JE) [1,2], the Crooks fluctuation theorem (CFT) [3,4] and the Evans-Searles fluctuation theorem [5-7] are important new results in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. To obtain experimentally applicable forms of these theorems which are valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, it is necessary to introduce a thermal reservoir that is large and remote enough from the system of interest, to effectively remain in equilibrium. To this end models involving synthetic thermostats, which only act on particles in the reservoir, have been developed [7-9]. The system of interest cannot possibly ''know'' the details of how the thermostat operates due to its remoteness from it. The details of the synthetic thermostat are then irrelevant to the final result [8]. This approach works well for mechanically driven systems in contact with a fixed temperature reservoir. However, matters are more complicated if we wish to consider a realistic model of a system that is driven away from equilibrium by a reservoir whose temperature is changing. For this case the simple parametric change in Hamiltonian or external field, usually employed in the derivation of the JE or the CFT, is not applicable and care is needed in developing the physical assumptions, see [10,11]. Here we address this issue by considering a system of interest, containing some very slowly relaxing constituents such as soft matter or pitch [12], in contact with a rapidly relaxing reservoir. The reservoir may be formed from a copper block or another highly thermally conductive material. Changing the temperature of the reservoir (say with a thermostatically controlled heat exchanger) then drives the system of interest out of equilibrium. The change in temperature is slow enough that the reservoir may be treated to high accuracy, as undergoing a quasistatic temperature change. The slowly relaxing system of interest is far from equilibrium. We develop generalised versions of the CFT and the JE applied to this system. Importantly the quantities that appear in our theory are physically measurable variables. We first state the CFT and the JE for the canonical ensemble. The thermodynamic potential is the Helmholtz free energy, A, which is related to the phase space {\"{y}}  q 1 ;. .. ; q N ; p;. .. ; p N  integral of the negative exponential of the Hamiltonian H 0 {\"{y}}, of the system [13] A  {\"{y}}k B T lnZ  {\"{y}}k B T ln Z d{\"{y}} exp{\"{y}}H 0 {\"{y}};  : (1) In this equation k B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature and  1=k B T.

It has recently been shown that small quantum subsystems generically equilibrate, in the sense that they spend most of the time close to a fixed equilibrium state. This relies on just two assumptions: that the state is spread over many different energies, and that the Hamiltonian has non-degenerate energy gaps. Given the same assumptions, it has also been shown that closed systems equilibrate with respect to realistic measurements. We extend these results in two important ways. Firstly, we prove equilibration over a finite (rather than infinite) time-interval, allowing us to bound the equilibration time. Secondly, we weaken the non-degenerate energy gaps condition, showing that equilibration occurs provided that no energy gap is hugely degenerate.},

If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the " half-way " point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel.

abstract = {The Jarzynski equality relates the free-energy diierence between two equilibrium states to the work done on a system through far-from-equilibrium processes-a milestone that builds on the pioneering work of Clausius and Kelvin. Although experimental tests of the equality have been performed in the classical regime, the quantum Jarzynski equality has not yet been fully verified owing to experimental challenges in measuring work and work distributions in a quantum system. Here, we report an experimental test of the quantum Jarzynski equality with a single 171 Yb + ion trapped in a harmonic potential. We perform projective measurements to obtain phonon distributions of the initial thermal state. We then apply a laser-induced force to the projected energy eigenstate and find transition probabilities to final energy eigenstates after the work is done. By varying the speed with which we apply the force from the equilibrium to the far-from-equilibrium regime, we verify the quantum Jarzynski equality in an isolated system. T here is increasing interest in non-equilibrium dynamics at the microscopic scale, crossing over quantum physics, thermodynamics and information theory as the experimental control and technology at such a scale have been developing rapidly. Most of the principles in non-equilibrium processes are represented in the form of inequalities, as seen in the example of the maximum work principle, W − F ≥ 0, where the average work W is equal to the free-energy difference F only in the case of the equilibrium process. In close-to-equilibrium processes, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is valid and connects the average dissipated energy W diss ≡ W − F and the fluctuation of the system $\sigma$ 2 /2k B T. Here $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the work distribution, T is the initial temperature of the system in thermal equilibrium and k B is the Boltzmann constant. Beyond the near-equilibrium regime, no exact results were known until Jarzynski found a remarkable equality 1 that relates the free-energy difference to the exponential average of the work done on the system: ln e −W diss /k B T = 0 (1) The Jarzynski equality (1) is satisfied irrespective of the protocols of varying parameters of the system even when the driving is arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The relation enables us to experimentally determine F of a system by repeatedly performing work at any speed. Experimental tests of the classical Jarzynski equality and its relation to the Crooks fluctuation theorem 2 have been successfully performed in various systems 3-12. In classical systems, work can be obtained by measuring the force and the displacement, and then integrating the force over the displacement during the driving process. In the quantum regime, however, as a result of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we cannot determine the position and the momentum simultaneously-thus invalidating the concepts of force and displacement. Instead of measuring these classical observables, it is necessary to carry out projective measurements over the energy eigenstates to determine the work done in each realization and the work distribution 13. With this understanding of work in quantum mechanics, the Jarzynski equality has been extended to the quantum regime 14-16 with simplicity and elegance for isolated systems, although the meaning of work and heat in open quantum systems is still not fully settled 17. Although the theoretical derivation of the quantum Jarzynski equality is unequivocal, similar to its classical counterpart, experimental verification in a variety of systems under a range of conditions would put it on a solid experimental foundation. For this reason, experimental testing of the quantum Jarzynski equality has been a long-sought goal for many physicists 18-24. However, even for an isolated quantum system, experimental verification has been constrained by the technical challenges in controlling quantum systems precisely and performing projective measurements to obtain the work distribution 18-21. There have been theoretical efforts to get around such difficulties by measuring the characteristic function and then reconstructing the work distribution 22-24. An experimental demonstration has appeared following those proposals 21. Nevertheless , a standard way 20 of verifying the quantum Jarzynski equality by direct measurement of the work distribution is still lacking. Here, we adopt the method of two measurements over energy eigenstates and obtain the work distribution. From the work distribution, we verify the quantum Jarzynski equality. In our experiment, we employ a trapped atomic 171 Yb + ion harmonic oscillator whose Hilbert space has infinite dimensions. We implement the projective measurement on phonons 25 to determine the initial eigenstate from the thermal distribution and perform the standard phonon-distribution measurement 26-29 after work is done on the projected eigenstate. Thus, we successfully measure work and work distributions in a genuine quantum system. With these experimental techniques, we test the quantum Jarzynski equality at various initial temperatures and switching speeds. We compare the performance of the Jazynski estimate of},

abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such " area laws " for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states.

abstract = {The realization of fully controlled, coherent many-body quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in science and engineering. As quantum simulators, they can provide insights into strongly correlated quantum systems and the role of quantum entanglement 1 , and ena-ble realizations and studies of new states of matter, even away from equilibrium. These systems also form the basis of the realization of quantum information processors 2 . Although basic building blocks of such processors have been demonstrated in systems of a few coupled qubits 3–5 , the current challenge is to increase the number of coherently coupled qubits to potentially perform tasks that are beyond the reach of modern classical machines. Several physical platforms are currently being explored to reach these goals. Systems composed of about 10–20 individually controlled atomic ions have been used to create entangled states and to explore quantum simulations of Ising spin models 6,7 . Similarly sized systems of pro-grammable superconducting qubits have been implemented recently 8 . Quantum simulations have been carried out in larger ensembles of more than 100 trapped ions without individual readout 9 . Strongly interacting quantum dynamics has been explored using optical lattice simulators 10 . These systems are already addressing computationally difficult problems in quantum dynamics 11 and the fermionic Hubbard model 12 . Larger-scale Ising-like machines have been realized in super-conducting 13 and optical 14 systems, but these realizations lack either coherence or quantum nonlinearity, which are essential for achieving full quantum speedup. Arrays of strongly interacting atoms A promising avenue for realizing strongly interacting quantum matter involves coherent coupling of neutral atoms to highly excited Rydberg states 15,16 (Fig. 1a). This results in repulsive van der Waals interactions (of strength = / V C R ij ij 6) between Rydberg atom pairs at a distance R ij (ref. 15), where C {\textgreater} 0 is the van der Waals coefficient. Such interactions have recently been used to realize quantum gates 17–19 , to implement strong photon–photon interactions 20 and to study quantum many-body physics of Ising spin systems in optical lattices 21–23 and in probabilistically loaded dipole trap arrays 24 . Our approach combines these strong, controllable interactions with atom-by-atom assembly of arrays of cold neutral 87 Rb atoms Planck constant. Here, we focus on homogeneous coherent coupling (|$\Omega$ i | = $\Omega$, $\Delta$ i = $\Delta$), controlled by changing laser intensities and detunings in time. The interaction strength V ij is tuned either by varying the distance between the atoms or by coupling them to a different Rydberg state. The experimental protocol that we implement is depicted in Fig. 1c (see also Extended Data Fig. 1). First, atoms are loaded from a magneto-optical trap into a tweezer array created by an acousto-optic deflector. We then use a measurement and feedback procedure that eliminates the entropy associated with the probabilistic trap loading and results in the rapid production of defect-free arrays with more than 50 laser-cooled atoms, as described previously 26},

abstract = {A key property of many-body localized Hamiltonians is the area law entanglement of even highly excited eigenstates. Matrix product states (MPS) can be used to efficiently represent low entanglement (area law) wave functions in one dimension. An important application of MPS is the widely used density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states of one-dimensional Hamil-tonians. Here, we develop two algorithms, the shift-and-invert MPS (SIMPS) and excited state DMRG which find highly excited eigenstates of many-body localized Hamiltonians. Excited state DMRG uses a modified sweeping procedure to identify eigenstates, whereas SIMPS applies the inverse of the shifted Hamiltonian to a MPS multiple times to project out the targeted eigenstate. To demonstrate the power of these methods, we verify the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in the many-body localized phase of the random field Heisenberg model, show the saturation of entanglement in the many-body localized phase, and generate local excitations.},

abstract = {In this review we discuss, from an experimental point of view, several concepts of statistical mechanics for systems that are out of equilib-rium either because they are driven by external forces or because they are slowly relaxing toward equilibrium. We focus on the case where the mean injected energy is of the order of thermal fluctuations, which therefore cannot be neglected. We first introduce the main concepts of fluctuation theorems (FTs) for work and heat using measurements of (a) a harmonic oscillator driven out of equilibrium by an external force and (b) a colloidal particle trapped in a time-dependent double-well potential. We use the example of the Brownian particle to analyze the problem of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in out-of-equilibrium systems. We next study the fluctuations of the position of a Brownian particle inside an aging gelatin after a fast quench. Using the experimental data of this experiment, we show that the mean heat flux is quantitatively related to the violation of the equi-librium fluctuation-dissipation theorem or equivalently to the entropy production rate. Finally, we discuss briefly the problems and the new directions for the stochastic thermodynamics.},

Using the precise existing data for the Fermi surface topography and quasiparticle velocities of Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7), we show that in the region of the T-linear resistivity, the scattering rate per kelvin is well approximated by the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the Planck constant divided by 2$\pi$. Extending the analysis to a number of other materials reveals similar results in the T-linear region, in spite of large differences in the microscopic origins of the scattering.},

abstract = {We investigate a many-body localization transition based on Boltzmann transport theory. Introducing weak-localization corrections into a Boltzmann equation, Hershfield and Ambegaokar rederived the Wolfle-Vollhardt self-consistent equation for the diffusion coefficient [Phys. Rev. B 34, 2147 (1986)]. We generalize this Boltzmann equation framework, introducing electron-electron interactions into the Hershfield-Ambegaokar Boltzmann transport theory based on the study of Zala-Narozhny-Aleiner [Phys. Rev. B 64, 214204 (2001)]. Here, not only Altshuler-Aronov corrections but also dephasing effects are taken into account. As a result, we obtain a self-consistent equation for the diffusion coefficient in terms of the disorder strength and temperature, which extends the Wolfle-Vollhardt self-consistent equation in the presence of electron correlations. Solving our self-consistent equation numerically, we find a many-body localization insulator-metal transition, where a metallic phase appears from dephasing effects dominantly instead of renormalization effects at high temperatures. Although this mechanism is consistent with that of recent seminal papers [Ann. Phys. (NY) 321, 1126 (2006); Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 206603 (2005)], we find that our three-dimensional metal-insulator transition belongs to the first-order transition, which differs from the Anderson metal-insulator transition described by the Wolfle-Vollhardt self-consistent theory. We speculate that a bimodal distribution function for the diffusion coefficient is responsible for this first-order phase transition.},

@article{Dewitt1967,
abstract = {Following an historical introduction, the conventional formulation of general relativity theory is presented. The canonical Lagrangian is expressed in terms of the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures of the hypersurface x{\textless}sup{\textgreater}o{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=constant, and its relation to the asymptotic field energy in an infinite world is noted. The distinction between finite and infinite worlds is emphasized. In the quantum theory the primary and secondary constraints become conditions on the state vector, and in the case of finite worlds these conditions alone govern the dynamics. A resolution of the factor-ordering problem is proposed, and the consistency of the constraints is demonstrated. A 6-dimensional hyperbolic Riemannian manifold is introduced which takes for its metric the coefficient of the momenta in the Hamiltonian constraint. The geodesic incompletability of this manifold, owing to the existence of a frontier of infinite curvature is demonstrated. The possibility is explored of relating this manifold to an infinite-dimensional manifold of 3-geometries, and of relating the structure of the latter manifold in turn to the dynamical behavior of space-time. The problem is approached through the WKB approximation and Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Einstein's equations are revealed as geodesic equations in the manifold of 3-geometries, modified by the presence of a "force term". The classical phenomenon of gravitational collapse shows that the force term is not powerful enough to prevent the trajectory of space-time from running into the frontier. The as-yet unresolved problem of determining when the collapse phenomenon represents a real barrier to the quantum-state functional is briefly discussed, and a boundary condition at the barrier is proposed. The state functional of a finite world can depend only on the 3-geometry of the hypersurface x{\textless}sup{\textgreater}o{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=constant. The label x{\textless}sup{\textgreater}o{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} itself is irrelevant, and "time" must be determined intrinsically. A natural definition for the inner product of two such state functionals is introduced which, however, encounters difficulties with negative probabilities owing to the barrier boundary condition. In order to resolve these difficulties, a simplified model, the quantized Friedmann universe, is studied in detail. In order to obtain nonstatic wave functions which resemble a universe evolving, it is necessary to introduce a clock. In order that the combined wave functions of universe-cum-clock be normalizable, it turns out that the periods of universe and clock must be commensurable. Wave packets exhibiting quasiclassical behavior are constructed, and attention is called to the phenomenological character of "time". The inner-product definition is rescued from its negative-probability difficulties by making use of the fact that probability flows in a closed finite circuit in configuration space. The article ends with some speculations on the uniqueness of the state functional of the actual universe. It is suggested that a viewpoint due to Everett should be adopted in its interpretation.},

We give a pedagogical introduction to the methodology of the Quench Action, which is an eective representation for the calculation of time-dependent expectation values of physical operators following a generic out-of-equilibrium state preparation protocol (for example a quantum quench). The representation, originally introduced in Caux and Essler (2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 257203), is founded on a mixture of exact data for overlaps together with variational reasonings. It is argued to be quite generally valid and thermodynamically exact for arbitrary times after the quench (from short times all the way up to the steady state), and applicable to a wide class of physically relevant observables. Here, we introduce the method and its language, give an overview of some recent results, suggest a roadmap and oer some perspectives on possible future research directions.},

We also identify two phase-transition-like behaviors in either the thermodynamic limit, at which the current probability distribution becomes discontinuous, or at maximal driving, when the range of possible current values changes discontinuously. In the thermodynamic limit the current has a finite upper and lower bound. We also explicitly confirm nonequilibrium fluctuation relation and show that the current distribution is the same under mapping of the coupling strength $\Gamma$ → 1=$\Gamma$.},

@article{Mcrae2017,
abstract = {Making use of bipolar transport in single-wall carbon nanotube quantum transistors would permit a single device to operate as both a quantum dot and a ballistic conductor or as two quantum dots with different charging energies. Here we report ultra-clean 10 to 100 nm scale suspended nanotube transistors with a large electron-hole transport asymmetry. The devices consist of naked nanotube channels contacted with sections of tube under annealed gold. The annealed gold acts as an n-doping top gate, allowing coherent quantum transport, and can create nanometre-sharp barriers. These tunnel barriers define a single quantum dot whose charging energies to add an electron or a hole are vastly different (e {\`{A}} h charging energy asymmetry). We parameterize the e {\`{A}} h transport asymmetry by the ratio of the hole and electron charging energies Z e {\`{A}} h . This asymmetry is maximized for short channels and small band gap tubes. In a small band gap device, we demonstrate the fabrication of a dual functionality quantum device acting as a quantum dot for holes and a much longer quantum bus for electrons. In a 14 nm-long channel, Z e {\`{A}} h reaches up to 2.6 for a device with a band gap of 270 meV. The charging energies in this device exceed 100 meV. A n important feature of ultra-clean (intrinsic) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) channels is that a small gate voltage can tune them from n-type (electron-doped) to p-type (hole-doped) devices. A large electron-hole (e {\`{A}} h) transport asymmetry would enable dual functionality quantum SWCNT transistors with drastically different characteristics under electron or hole doping. Unfortunately, the intrinsic transport properties of SWCNTs are mostly e {\`{A}} h symmetric 1,2 and thus the two types of transport are redundant. Nevertheless, quantum SWCNT devices can be engineered to create an e {\`{A}} h transport asymmetry. This is achieved for instance in SWCNT quantum dot (QD) transistors whose tunnel barrier heights depend on whether the channel is n-or p-doped. Such a transport asymmetry has been demonstrated in ultra-clean devices with channel lengths ranging from a few hundreds to 100 nm 3,4 . Downsizing ultra-clean e {\`{A}} h asymmetric SWCNT transistors to 10 nm would create QDs, which can be toggled between two vastly different charging energies. They would be useful to explore fundamental nano-electro-mechanical system (NEMS) physics 5–9 and qubits 2,10–12 at energy scales close the ones in single molecules 13,14 or to create THz bolometers 15 , which are sensitive to two different wavelength ranges (one for each E C). In addition, a large e {\`{A}} h transport asymmetry in SWCNT transistors could allow them to act as both active logic elements (QDs) for hole doping and interconnects (quantum bus) for electron doping. This dual functionality is needed to create reconfigurable logic circuits which can be programmed with gate voltages 16 and would support the development of commercial SWCNT electronics 17 . Here we demonstrate the capability to engineer a giant e {\`{A}} h charging energy and conductance asymmetry in ultra-clean (single QD or ballistic) suspended SWCNT channels whose lengths range down to 14 nm. Ultra-clean SWCNTs used to explore many-body physics and quantum bits have previously been limited to channel lengths above 100 nm 3,7,10–12,18–20 . The key feature of our fabrication is to use an annealed-gold film as an electrostatic gate directly deposited on a SWCNT (no dielectric spacer). This n-dopes the gold-covered SWCNT sections, which then act as contacts to the naked channel. These gold gates create extremely sharp barriers at the contact-to-channel interfaces (few nanometres wide) and these barriers have different heights whether the channel is n-or p-doped. We measured transport in five devices under both electron and hole doping of their channels, and at temperatures ranging from 1.3 to 295 K. In a small gap SWCNT device (Device A), E C 's for electrons and holes differ by orders of magnitude. When this device's channel is p-doped, it forms a 102 nm-long low-disorder QD. When the channel is n-doped, the device becomes a one-dimensional waveguide where carriers can travel E330 nm without losing their phase coherence. In the four devices whose band gaps E g $\backslash$200 meV, the charging energy asymmetry ratio Z e {\`{A}} h of the charging energies for holes, E h},

In three dimensions (3D) we find that the Anderson localization transitions appear to be in the same universality class as for random potentials. In scaling or renormalization group terms, this means that randomness of the potential is irrelevant at the Anderson localization transitions in 3D. In two dimensions (2D) we also explore the Ando model, which is in the symplectic symmetry class and shows an Anderson localization transition for random potentials. Here, unlike in 3D, we find that the universality class changes when we instead use a quasiperiodic potential.},

abstract = {Most nonequilibrium processes in thermodynamics are quantified only by inequalities; however, the Jarzynski relation presents a remarkably simple and general equality relating nonequilibrium quantities with the equilibrium free energy, and this equality holds in both the classical and quantum regimes. We report a single-spin test and confirmation of the Jarzynski relation in the quantum regime using a single ultracold 40 Ca þ ion trapped in a harmonic potential, based on a general information-theoretic equality for a temporal evolution of the system sandwiched between two projective measurements. By considering both initially pure and mixed states, respectively, we verify, in an exact and fundamental fashion, the nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics relevant to the mutual information and Jarzynski equality. Since the original proposals of the celebrated ideas of Maxwell's demon [1] and Szil{\'{a}}rd's engine [2], much effort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermo-dynamics by reconsidering the meaning of thermodynamic entropic and energetic costs. So far, the field of information thermodynamics has reformulated the restrictions of the original thermodynamics, e.g., the second law of thermo-dynamics, in light of the interplay between the amount of information and its thermodynamic utility. Reconsideration of the second law based on the notion of information and further clarifications of the physical nature of information are typically expected to reconcile any apparent contra-dictions we might have regarding our understanding of the laws of thermodynamics [3]. In addition to this, there has been a parallel line of development because the conventional equilibrium thermo-dynamics cannot reasonably treat most natural or engi-neered processes that occur far from equilibrium. Namely, the nonequilibrium processes in thermodynamics are usu-ally described by inequalities (or equalities that only hold in the linear regime, which means not far from equilibrium). In contrast, the Jarzynski relation presents a simple and general equality to calculate the free-energy difference between two states from Boltzmann-weighted statistics of the irreversible work done along the trajectories arbi-trarily out of equilibrium [4]. As the only equality in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the Jarzynski relation can also be understood from the fluctuation theorem [5] under the assumption of microscopically reversible and thermo-stated dynamics. The ensuing investigations [6–9] have further confirmed that the Jarzynski equality promises to correctly predict any behavior, adiabatic or arbitrarily fast, in the presence of the Boltzmann statistics. A comprehen-sive review of thermodynamic experiments, using single molecules and colloidal particles, regarding the fluctuation theorem can be found in [10]. Understanding the thermodynamic process at the quan-tum level is currently a topic attracting much attention [11–13]. Several attempts have been made to extend the Jarzynski relation to quantum regime [14–20]. From the quantum perspective, the origin of fluctuations is no longer just thermal but also quantum, and most thermodynamic quantities should be retraced. For example, the amount of work itself is not an observable in quantum thermodynam-ics, and its quantification therefore needs to be reconsidered [17,18,21,22]. Besides this, the quantum entropy is actually an indication of the entanglement between the system and its environment [23], and is no longer simply the thermo-dynamic arrow of time. Here we show a single-spin verification of an information-theoretic equality relevant to Jarzynski relation via experimental manipulation of a trapped-ion system.},

Two efficiency metrics are used to compare quantum and classical resources for rare-event sampling. For a fixed stochastic process, the first is the classical-to-quantum ratio of required memory. We show for two example processes that there exists an infinite number of rare-event classes for which the memory ratio for sampling is larger than r, for any large real number r. Then, for a sequence of processes each labeled by an integer size N, we compare how the classical and quantum required memories scale with N. In this setting, since both memories can diverge as N → ∞, the efficiency metric tracks how fast they diverge. An extreme quantum memory advantage exists when the classical memory diverges in the limit N → ∞, but the quantum memory has a finite bound. We then show that finite-state Markov processes and spin chains exhibit memory advantage for sampling of almost all of their rare-event classes.},

abstract = {Expokit provides a set of routines aimed at computing matrix exponentials. More precisely, it computes either a small matrix exponential in full, the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on an operand vector, or the solution of a system of linear ODEs with constant inhomogeneity. The backbone of the sparse routines consists of matrix-free Krylov subspace projection methods (Arnoldi and Lanczos processes), and that is why the toolkit is capable of coping with sparse matrices of large dimension. The software handles real and complex matrices and provides specific routines for symmetric and Hermitian matrices. The computation of matrix exponentials is a numerical issue of critical importance in the area of Markov chains and furthermore, the computed solution is subject to probabilistic constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient states of Markov chains.},

@article{Barrett,
abstract = {As the realization of a fully operational quantum computer remains distant, quantum simulation, whereby one quantum system is engineered to simulate another, becomes a key goal of great practical importance. Here we report on a variational method exploiting the natural physics of cavity QED architectures to simulate strongly interacting quantum fields. Our scheme is broadly applicable to any architecture involving tunable and strongly nonlinear interactions with light; as an example, we demonstrate that existing cavity devices could simulate models of strongly interacting bosons. The scheme can be extended to simulate systems of entangled multicomponent fields, beyond the reach of existing classical simulation methods. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.090501 PACS numbers: 03.67.Ac, 03.70.+k, 42.50.Ex, 42.50.Pq Modelling interacting many-particle systems classically is a challenging yet tractable problem. However, in the quantum regime, it becomes rapidly intractable, owing to the dramatic increase in the number of variables required to describe the system. Feynman [1] realized that an alternate approach would be to exploit quantum mechanics to carry out simulations beyond the reach of classical computers. This idea was the basis of Lloyd's simulation algorithm [2], a procedure for a digital quantum computer to simulate the dynamics of a strongly interacting quantum system. In contrast, there is also an analogue approach to quantum simulation, where the simulator's Hamiltonian is tailored to match that of the simulated system [3]. The comple-mentary aspects of the analogue and digital methods, reviewed in Refs. [3–7], have led to a host of recent experiments [8–16]. To date, most experimental implementations of quantum simulation algorithms have been focussed on the task of simulating quantum lattice systems, with comparatively less attention paid to systems with continuous degrees of freedom. The archetypal example of a quantum system with a continuous degree of freedom is the quantum field. Currently, quantum simulations of quantum field theories have relied on discretization of the dynamical degrees of freedom. One body of recent theoretical work is focussed on the analogue simulation of discretized quantum fields, using cold atoms in optical lattices [17–21] and coupled cavity arrays [22–24]. Complementing this are proposals for digital quantum simulation on a universal quantum computer of the zero-temperature [25] and thermal [26] dynamics of non-Abelian gauge theories and, more recently, a digital quantum simulation [27,28] of scattering processes of a discretized 4 quantum field. In this Letter, we report on an analogue algorithm to simulate the ground-state physics of a one-dimensional strongly interacting quantum field using the continuous output of a cavity-QED apparatus [29–33]. Our method involves no discretization of the dynamical degrees of freedom; the simulation register is the continuous electro-magnetic output mode of the cavity. The variational wave function generated in this way, therefore, belongs to an extremely expressive class, namely the class of continuous matrix product states, as we will show. We argue that our approach is already realizable with state-of-the-art cavity-QED technology. We concentrate on simulating quantum fields modelling collections of strongly interacting bosons in one spatial dimension. These systems are compactly described in sec-ond quantization using the quantum field annihilation and creation operators {\^{}} c ðxÞ and {\^{}} c},

Their classical limit as well as their relations to the corresponding canonical expressions are discussed. A fluctuation theorem is derived that expresses the ratio of probabilities of work for a process and its time reversal to the ratio of densities of states of the microcanonical equilibrium systems with corresponding initial and final Hamiltonians. From this Crooks-type fluctuation theorem a relation between entropies of different systems can be derived which does not involve the time-reversed process. This entropy-from-work theorem provides an experimentally accessible way to measure entropies.},

Studying finite-size effects we show numerically and theoretically that a very large crossover length exists that controls the passage of a clean-system dominated dynamics to one observed in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract = {Coherent interactions that generate negligible entanglement can still exhibit unique quantum behaviour. This observation has motivated a search beyond entanglement for a complete description of all quantum correlations. Quantum discord is a promising candidate. Here, we demonstrate that under certain measurement constraints, discord between bipartite systems can be consumed to encode information that can only be accessed by coherent quantum interactions. The inability to access this information by any other means allows us to use discord to directly quantify this 'quantum advantage'. We experimentally encode information within the discordant correlations of two separable Gaussian states. The amount of extra information recovered by coherent interaction is quantified and directly linked with the discord consumed during encoding. No entanglement exists at any point of this experiment. Thus we introduce and demonstrate an operational method to use discord as a physical resource. C orrelations lie at the heart of our capacity to manipulate information. The fewer the constraints on the correlations we can exploit, the greater our capacity to manipulate information in ways we desire. The rapid development of quantum information science is a testament to this observation. Quantum systems may be so correlated that they are 'entangled', such that each of their subsystems possesses no local reality. Exploitation of such uniquely quantum correlations has led to many remarkable protocols that would otherwise be either impossible or infeasible 1–4 . However, the absence of entanglement does not eliminate all signatures of quantum behaviour 5 .

abstract = {The third law of thermodynamics has a controversial past and a number of formulations due to Planck, Einstein, and Nernst. It's most accepted version, the unattainability principle, states that "any thermodynamic process cannot reach the temperature of absolute zero by a finite number of steps and within a finite time." Although formulated in 1912, there has been no general proof of the principle, and the only evidence we have for it is that particular cooling methods become less efficient as the temperature decreases. Here we provide the first derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any particular temperature, and translate these resources into a minimal time or number of steps by considering the notion of a Thermal Machine which obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of the bath being positive, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect cooling in finite time is in principle possible. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the Unattainability Principle and the Heat Theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.},

@article{DiSalvo1999,
abstract = {In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power.},

abstract = {A new theorem shows that noise can speed convergence to equilibrium in discrete finite-state Markov chains. The noise applies to the state density and helps the Markov chain explore improbable regions of the state space. The theorem ensures that a stochastic-resonance noise benefit exists for states that obey a vector-norm inequality. Such noise leads to faster convergence because the noise reduces the norm components. A corollary shows that a noise benefit still occurs if the system states obey an alternate norm inequality. This leads to a noise-benefit algorithm that requires knowledge of the steady state. An alternative blind algorithm uses only past state information to achieve a weaker noise benefit. Simulations illustrate the predicted noise benefits in three well-known Markov models. The first model is a two-parameter Ehrenfest diffusion model that shows how noise benefits can occur in the class of birth-death processes. The second model is a Wright-Fisher model of genotype drift in population genetics. The third model is a chemical reaction network of zeolite crystallization. A fourth simulation shows a convergence rate increase of 64{\%} for states that satisfy the theorem and an increase of 53{\%} for states that satisfy the corollary. A final simulation shows that even suboptimal noise can speed convergence if the noise applies over successive time cycles. Noise benefits tend to be sharpest in Markov models that do not converge quickly and that do not have strong absorbing states.},

abstract = {When an isolated system is brought in contact with a heat bath, its final energy is random and follows the Gibbs distribution—this finding is a cornerstone of statistical physics. The system's energy can also be changed by performing non-adiabatic work using a cyclic process. Almost nothing is known about the resulting energy distribution in this set-up, which is in particular relevant to recent experimental progress in cold atoms, ion traps, superconducting qubits and other systems. Here we show that when the non-adiabatic process consists of many repeated cyclic processes, the resulting energy distribution is universal and different from the Gibbs ensemble. We predict the existence of two qualitatively different regimes with a continuous second-order-like transition between them. We illustrate our approach by performing explicit calculations for both interacting and non-interacting systems. U nderstanding the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of thermally isolated systems has moved to the forefront of research owing to experimental developments over the past decade, particularly in cold atom systems 1 , trapped ions 2 , nuclear spins 3 and superconducting qubits 4 . In these systems the coupling to external dissipative degrees of freedom is strongly suppressed and irrelevant on accessible timescales. These systems provide a new playground where one can investigate fundamental questions concerning statistical and quantum physics. Moreover, they indicate new practical applications, in particular in the context of quantum information. The experimental studies have inspired intensive theoretical research on a variety of topics. These include equilibration in isolated systems initially driven out of equilibrium by a sudden change in a coupling constant (a quench); defect (or energy) generation during slow, nearly adiabatic processes in gapless phases or near singularities, such as quantum phase transitions (for a review see refs 5,6); non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions in the presence of 1/f noise 7 ; and many more. In this work, we consider the energy distribution of a thermally isolated system following a non-adiabatic process. Consider two set-ups where the energy of an isolated system is changed. In the first, the system is brought into contact with a heat bath until equilibration and then disconnected from it—similar to an oven. In the second the energy of the system is increased owing to a non-adiabatic change of some external parameter(s)—much like a microwave oven. The two set-ups are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Our interest is in the energy distribution of each of the systems at the end of the process. For the first set-up the result is well-known and corresponds to the classic heating mechanism, which can be found in any book on thermodynamics (see for example ref. 8). If, as usual, the bath is large compared with the system then the energy distribution of the system becomes Gaussian, with a canonical width uniquely determined by the fluctuation–dissipation relation: $\delta$E 2 = T 2 C v , where T is the temperature and C v is the specific heat (we work in the units where k b = 1). This relation is valid for both quantum and classical systems, and is independent of the details of the interactions between the system and the bath. Now, consider a second set-up where the},

abstract = {
A very fundamental problem in quantum statistical mechanics involves whether— and how—an isolated quantum system will reach thermal equilibrium after waiting a long time. In quantum systems that do thermalize, the long-time expectation value of any “reasonable” operator will match its predicted value in the canonical ensemble. The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) posits that this thermalization occurs at the level of each individual energy eigenstate; in fact, any single eigenstate in a micro- canonical energy window will predict the expectation values of such operators exactly. In the first part of this dissertation, we identify, for a generic model system, precisely which operators satisfy ETH, as well as limits to the information contained in a single eigenstate. Remarkably, our results strongly suggest that a single eigenstate can con- tain information about energy densities—and therefore temperatures—far away from the energy density of the eigenstate.
Additionally, we study the possible breakdown of quantum thermalization in a model of itinerant electrons on a one-dimensional chain, with both spin and charge degrees of freedom. This model exhibits peculiar properties in the entanglement entropy, the apparent scaling of which is modified from a “volume law” to an “area law” after performing a partial, site-wise measurement on the system. These properties and others suggest that this model realizes a new, non-thermal phase of matter, known as a Quantum Disentan- gled Liquid (QDL). The putative existence of this phase has striking implications for the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.},

abstract = {In the field of quantum simulation, methods and tools are explored for simulating the dynamics of a quantum system of interest with another system that is easier to control and measure. Systems of trapped atomic ions can be accurately controlled and manipulated, a large variety of interactions can be engineered with high precision and measurements of relevant observables can be obtained with nearly 100{\%} efficiency. Here, we discuss prospects for quantum simulations using systems of trapped ions, and review the available set of quantum operations and first proof-of-principle experiments for both analog and digital quantum simulations with trapped ions. T he field of quantum information has emerged during the past decade, together with the much refined art of controlling and manipulating quantum systems. Arguably, it is today one of the most lively—and still growing—research areas in physics, with widespread potential applications. The ultimate goal in this field is the realization of a universal quantum computer, promising unprecedented computing power. Reaching that goal, however, will still require many years, if not decades, of improvements in technology and fundamental research. There are, however, no principle roadblocks in sight 1 . Although universal quantum computers for large-scale operations are probably quite a while in the future, research during the past few years has clearly shown that with small numbers of quantum bits (or qubits) a number of applications already become interesting where well controlled quantum systems can be favourably employed. Examples include frequency standards where entangling operations enhance the state detection 2 , tests of quantum theory in multiqubit systems 3,4 or the use of qubits as a quantum memory for quantum repeaters. The power of quantum-information processing is based on the exponentially growing number of computational paths that are available in quantum systems consisting of an increasing number of qubits.

abstract = {S pin transport and manipulation in semiconductors have been studied intensively with the ultimate goal of realizing spintronic devices. Previous work in GaAs has focused on controlling the carrier density 1 , crystallographic orientation 2 and dimensionality 3,4 to limit the electron spin decoherence and allow transport over long distances 4–7 . Here, we introduce a new method for the coherent transport of spin-polarized electronic wave packets using dynamic quantum dots (DQDs) created by the piezoelectric field of coherent acoustic phonons 8–11 . Photogenerated spin carriers transported by the DQDs in undoped GaAs (001) quantum wells exhibit a spin coherence length exceeding 100 µm, which is attributed to the simultaneous control of the carrier density and the dimensionality 12 by the DQDs during transport. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, we observe the precession of the electron spin induced by the internal magnetic field associated with the spin splitting of the conduction band (Dresselhaus term) 13 . The coherent manipulation of the precession frequency is also achieved by applying an external magnetic field. A square array of DQDs is produced by the interference of two orthogonally travelling beams of coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs) stimulated using interdigitated transducers (IDTs) deposited on the surface of an undoped GaAs (001) quantum well sample (Fig.},

We find closed-form expressions for the resulting work distribution function, and we find that they are proper physical observables of the quantum field theory. Also, we show explicitly that the Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorems hold at one-loop order independent of the renormalization scale.

Using an exact Krylov space technique, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the random-field Heisenberg chain is studied up to L = 28 sites, starting from an initially unentangled high-energy product state. Within most of the delocalized phase, we find a sub-ballistic entanglement growth S(t) ∝ t 1/z with a disorder-dependent exponent z 1, in contrast with the pure ballistic growth z = 1 of clean systems. At the same time, anomalous relaxation is also observed for the spin imbalance I(t) ∝ t −$\zeta$ with a continuously varying disorder-dependent exponent $\zeta$ , vanishing at the transition. This provides a clear experimental signature for detecting this nonconventional regime.},

abstract = {An equation-by-equation (EBE) method is proposed to solve a system of nonlinear equations arising from the moment constrained maximum entropy problem of multidimensional variables. The design of the EBE method combines ideas from homotopy continuation and Newton's iterative methods. Theoretically, we establish the local convergence under appropriate conditions and show that the proposed method, geometrically, finds the solution by searching along the surface corresponding to one component of the nonlinear problem. We will demonstrate the robustness of the method on various numerical examples, including (1) a six-moment one-dimensional entropy problem with an explicit solution that contains components of order 10 0-10 3 in magnitude, (2) four-moment multidimensional entropy problems with explicit solutions where the resulting systems to be solved range from 70-310 equations, and (3) four-to eight-moment of a two-dimensional entropy problem, whose solutions correspond to the densities of the two leading EOFs of the wind stress-driven large-scale oceanic model. In this case, we find that the EBE method is more accurate compared to the classical Newton's method, the MATLAB generic solver, and the previously developed BFGS-based method, which was also tested on this problem. The fourth example is four-moment constrained of up to five-dimensional entropy problems whose solutions correspond to multidimensional densities of the components of the solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. For the higher-dimensional cases of this example, the EBE method is superior because it automatically selects a subset of the prescribed moment constraints from which the maximum entropy solution can be estimated within the desired tolerance. This selection feature is particularly important since the moment constrained maximum entropy problems do not necessarily have solutions in general.},

abstract = {The work fluctuations of an oscillator in contact with a thermostat and driven out of equilibrium by an external force are studied experimentally and theoretically within the context of fluctuation theorems. The oscillator dynamics is modeled by a second order Langevin equation. Both the transient and stationary state fluctuation theorems hold and the finite time corrections are very different from those of a first order Langevin equation. The periodic forcing of the oscillator is also studied; it presents new and unexpected short time convergences. Analytical expressions are given in all cases. In this Letter, we investigate, within the context of the fluctuation theorems (FTs), the work fluctuations of a harmonic oscillator in contact with a thermostat and driven out of equilibrium by an external force. First found in dynamical systems [1,2] and later extended to stochastic systems [3-6], these conventional FTs give a relation between the probabilities to observe a positive value of the (time averaged) ''entropy production rate'' and a negative one. This relation is of the form P=P{\"{y}}  exp, where and {\"{y}} are equal but opposite values for the entropy production rate, P and P{\"{y}} give their probabilities, and is the length of the interval over which is measured. In these systems, the above mentioned FT is derived for a mathematical quantity , which has a form similar to that of the entropy production rate in irreversible thermodynamics [7]. The proof of FTs is based on a certain number of hypotheses; experimenting on a real device is useful not only to check those hypotheses, but also to observe whether the predicted effects are observable or remain only a theoretical tool. There are not many experimental tests of FTs. Some of them are performed in dynamical systems [8] in which the interpretation of the results is very difficult. Other experiments are performed on stochastic systems, one on a Brownian particle in a moving optical trap [9] and another on electrical circuits driven out of equilibrium by injecting in it a small current [10]. The last two systems are described by first order Langevin equations and the results agree with the predictions of Refs. [5,6]. Systems described by second order Langevin equations have been studied [3], but to our knowledge no predictions on the finite time corrections, as the ones from [5,6] for the power injected into the system are available. The test using a harmonic oscillator is particularly important because the harmonic oscillator is the basis of many physical processes. Indeed the general predictions of FTs are valid only for ! 1 and the corrections for finite have been computed only for a first order Langevin dynamics. In the present Letter, we address several important questions. We investigate first the transient fluctuation theorem (TFT) of the total external work done on the system in the transient state, i.e., considering a time interval of duration which starts immediately after the external force has been applied to the oscillator. We then analyze the stationary state fluctuation theorem (SSFT), which concerns fluctuations in the stationary state, i.e., in intervals of duration starting at a time long after the external force has been applied. We also study a new case of stationary behavior obtained when the system is driven periodically in time [11]. In this case, which is actually a very important one, no theoretical prediction is available. We show that the finite time corrections for SSFT are already very complex in both these rather simple situations. To test the FT we measure the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of a harmonic oscillator whose damping is mainly produced by the viscosity of the surrounding fluid, which acts as a thermal bath of temperature T. We recall here only the main features of the experimental setup, more details can be found in Refs. [12,13]. The oscillator is a torsion pendulum composed of a brass wire and a glass mirror glued in the middle of this wire. It is enclosed in a cell filled by a water-glycerol solution at 60{\%} concentration. The motion of this pendulum can be described by a second order Langevin equation: I eff d 2 dt 2  d dt  C  M   2k B T p ; (1) where is the angular displacement of the pendulum, I eff is the total moment of inertia of the displaced masses, is the oscillator viscous damping, C is the elastic torsional stiffness of the wire, M is the external torque, k B the Boltzmann constant, and the noise, delta correlated in time.

The external torque M is applied by means of a tiny electric current J flowing in a coil glued behind the mirror. The coil is inside a static magnetic field, hence M / J. The measurement of is performed by a differential interferometer, which uses two laser beams impinging on the pendulum mirror [12,13]. The measure-PRL 97, 140603 (2006) P H Y S I C A L},

Assuming particle systems, we construct the grand-canonical TPQ (gTPQ) state, which is the counterpart of the grand-canonical Gibbs state of the ensemble formulation. A single realization of the gTPQ state gives all quantities of statistical-mechanical interest, with exponentially small probability of error. This formulation not only sheds new light on quantum statistical mechanics but also is useful for practical computations. As an illustration, we apply it to the Hubbard model, on a one-dimensional (1D) chain and on a two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice. For the 1D chain, our results agree well with the exact solutions over wide ranges of temperature, chemical potential, and the on-site interaction. For the 2D triangular lattice, for which exact results are unknown, we obtain reliable results over a wide range of temperature. We also find that finite-size effects are much smaller in the gTPQ state than in the canonical TPQ state. This also shows that in the ensemble formulation the grand-canonical Gibbs state of a finite-size system simulates an infinite system much better than the canonical Gibbs state.},

abstract = {The study of nonequilibrium phenomena in correlated lattice systems has developed into one of the most active and exciting branches of condensed matter physics. This research field provides rich new insights that could not be obtained from the study of equilibrium situations, and the theoretical understanding of the physics often requires the development of new concepts and methods. On the experimental side, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies enable studies of excitation and relaxation phenomena in correlated electron systems, while ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a new way to control and measure the time evolution of interacting lattice systems with a vastly different characteristic time scale compared to electron systems. A theoretical description of these phenomena is challenging because, first, the quantum-mechanical time evolution of many-body systems out of equilibrium must be computed and second, strong-correlation effects which can be of a nonperturbative nature must be addressed. This review discusses the nonequilibrium extension of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which treats quantum fluctuations in the time domain and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. The method reduces the complexity of the calculation via a mapping to a self-consistent impurity problem, which becomes exact in infinite dimensions. Particular emphasis is placed on a detailed derivation of the formalism, and on a discussion of numerical techniques, which enable solutions of the effective nonequilibrium DMFT impurity problem. Insights gained into the properties of the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model under strong nonequilibrium conditions are summarized. These examples illustrate the current ability of the theoretical framework to reproduce and understand fundamental nonequilibrium phenomena, such as the dielectric breakdown of Mott insulators, photodoping, and collapse-and-revival oscillations in quenched systems. Furthermore, remarkable novel phenomena have been predicted by the nonequilibrium DMFT simulations of correlated lattice systems, including dynamical phase transitions and field-induced repulsion-to-attraction conversions.},

abstract = {Two fundamental ingredients play a decisive role in the foundation of fluctuation relations: the principle of microreversibility and the fact that thermal equilibrium is described by the Gibbs canonical ensemble. Building on these two pillars the reader is guided through a self-contained exposition of the theory and applications of quantum fluctuation relations. These are exact results that constitute the fulcrum of the recent development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. The material is organized in a way that emphasizes the historical connection between quantum fluctuation relations and (non)linear response theory. A number of fundamental issues are clarified which were not completely settled in the prior literature. The main focus is on (i) work fluctuation relations for transiently driven closed or open quantum systems, and (ii) on fluctuation relations for heat and matter exchange in quantum transport settings. Recently performed and proposed experimental applications are presented and discussed. DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.83.771 PACS numbers: 05.30.{\`{A}}d, 05.40.{\`{A}}a, 05.60.Gg, 05.70.Ln CONTENTS I.

abstract = {We present a universal relation between the flow of a Renyi entropy and the full counting statistics of energy transfers. We prove the exact relation for a flow to a system in thermal equilibrium that is weakly coupled to an arbitrary time-dependent and nonequilibrium system. The exact correspondence, given by this relation, provides a simple protocol to quantify the flows of Shannon and Renyi entropies from the measurements of energy transfer statistics. Exact correspondences between seemingly different concepts play an important role in all fields of physics. An example is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which states that the linear response of a system to externally applied forces corresponds to the system fluctuations [1,2]. In the last decade, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem has initiated important developments in quantum transport, quantum computation, and other similar phenomenological theories [3]. This theorem can be extended to nonlinear responses [4] and to full counting statistics (FCS) [5], giving more extended sets of such relations similar to Crooks' formula [6]. In this paper we present a relation similar to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem that provides an exact correspondence between the flows of Renyi entropy and FCS of energy transfers. In transport theory, stationary flow of a physical quantity can take place from a system into an infinitely large system. In the case a quantity is locally conserved in each system, its flow is determined only by interaction between the two systems [7]. The traditional examples include electric current, which is the flow of charge, and energy flow. Moreover, there are other conserved quantities which are not physical in a strict sense. An example is the generalization of entropy by Renyi into S M = n p M n , with p n being the probability to be in state n and arbitrary M {\textgreater} 0 [8]. Quantum generalization of the Renyi entropy is obviously conserved in a system under Hamiltonian evolution, with the Hamiltonian involving only the degrees of freedom of this system [9]. For a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T this entropy corresponds to the difference of free energies, i.e., ln S M = F (T) − F (T /M). In nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the Renyi entropies have already been considered [10]. They have been studied in strongly interacting systems [11,12], in particular spin chains [13,14]. The Renyi entropies in quantum physics are considered unphysical, or nonobservable, due to their nonlinear dependence on density matrix. So is the Shannon entropy, which is derived from the Renyi entropy S = lim M→1 ∂S M /∂M [9]. Such quantities cannot be determined from immediate measurements; instead their quantification seems to be equivalent to determining the density matrix. This requires re-initialization of the density matrix between many successive measurements [15]. Therefore, the flows of Renyi entropy between systems F M ≡ −d ln S M /dt are the conserved measures of nonphysical quantities. The same pertains to Shannon entropy flow [9]. An interesting and nontrivial question is: Is there any relation between the flows of Renyi entropy and the physical flows? An idea of such relation was first put forward by Levitov and Klich in [16], where they proposed that the Shannon entropy flow can be quantified from the measurement of full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transfers. The validity of this relation is restricted to vanishing temperature and obviously to the systems where interaction occurs by means of charge transfer. This has been further elaborated in [17]. In this paper we present a relation which is similar in spirit. It gives a correspondence between the flows of Renyi and Shannon entropies and the FCS of energy transfer in the limit of weak coupling. From analysis of the previous results for entropy production in quantum point contact [16,18] and more general perturbative derivations in [9], the Shannon entropy flow is known to be proportional to heat flow in the absence of external forces. This is violated in higher-order perturbation series. This implies that the exact correspondence does not hold for strong coupling limit. I. DEFINITIONS AND RESULT We consider two quantum systems X and Y. We assume that the system X is infinitely large and is kept in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. The system Y is arbitrary: it can encompass several degrees of freedom as well as infinitely many of those. It does not have to be in thermal equilibrium and in general is subject to time-dependent forces. It is convenient to assume that these forces are periodic with period $\tau$. However, this period does not enter explicitly in formulation of our result, which is also valid for aperiodic forces. The only requirement is that there is a stationary limit of the flows of physical quantities to the system X. The stationary limit is defined by averaging the instant flow over the period $\tau$. For aperiodic forces it is determined by averaging over a sufficiently long time interval. The energy transfer is statistical. The FCS of energy transfers concentrates on the probability P (E tr ,T) to have energy transfer of E tr during time interval T [19,20]. In the low frequency limit of long T all statistical cumulants of the energy transfer are proportional to T and are determined from the generating function F ($\xi$) = dE tr P (E tr ,T) exp(i$\xi$ E tr) ≈ exp[−T ¯ f ($\xi$)]. The parameter $\xi$ is a characteristic parameter and cumulants are given by expansion of ¯ f ($\xi$) in $\xi$ at $\xi$ = 0. For quantification of the Renyi entropy flow we need to define an auxiliary FCS of energy transfer. The most general 1098-0121/2015/91(17)/174307(8) 174307-1},

abstract = {A careful treatment of the zero-point energy of the spin-waves in the Kramers-Heller semiclassical theory of ferromagnetics leads to surprisingly exact results for the properties of the ground state, as shown by Klein and Smith. An analogous treatment of the antiferromagnetic ground state, whose properties were unknown, is here carried out and justified. The results are expected to be valid to order 1S or better, where S is the spin quantum number of the separate atoms. The energy of the ground state is computed and found to lie within limits found elsewhere on rigorous grounds. For the linear chain, there is no long-range order in the ground state; for the simple cubic and plane square lattices, a finite long-range order in the ground state is found. The fact that this order can be observed experimentally, somewhat puzzling since one knows the ground state to be a singlet, is explained.},

@article{Marbach2018,
abstract = {The transport of fluids at the nanoscale has achieved major breakthroughs over recent years 1-4 ; however, artificial channels still cannot match the efficiency of biological porins in terms of fluxes or selectivity. Pore shape agitation-due to thermal fluctuations or in response to external stimuli-is believed to facilitate transport in biochannels 5-9 , but its impact on transport in artificial pores remains largely unex-plored. Here we introduce a general theory for transport through thermally or actively fluctuating channels, which quantifies the impact of pore fluctuations on confined diffusion in terms of the spectral statistics of the channel fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate a complex interplay between transport and surface wiggling: agitation enhances diffusion via the induced fluid flow, but spatial variations in pore geometry can induce a slowing down via entropic trapping , in full agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and existing observations from the literature. Our results elucidate the impact of pore agitation in a broad range of artificial and biological porins, but also, at larger scales, in vascular motion in fungi, intestinal contractions and micro-fluidic surface waves. These results open up the possibility that transport across membranes can be actively tuned by external stimuli, with potential applications to nanoscale pumping, osmosis and dynamical ultrafiltration. "Everything that living things do can be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of atoms": this quotation by R. P. Feynman highlights the importance of fluctuations in living matter. Transport driven by fluctuations in biological nanopores is no exception to this rule, and has been widely investigated 5-9. Similar observations have been made in (non-living) fluid phases, where bulk hydrodynamic fluctuations dramatically affect nanoscale dynamics 10-12. More recently, numerical simulations have noted the impact of phonon modes in carbon nanotubes on the transport of particles confined within them 13-15. At much larger scales, microfluidic surface waves have been exploited to sort or mix solute particles 16 , and peristalsis in fungal species or in the small intestine significantly modifies nutrient and bacterial transport 17,18. While these observations-which span a considerable range of length scales-point to a quantitative impact of surface agitation on the transport in confined geometries, a general theory, predicting the dependence of transport properties on the surface fluctuations, is lacking. Even the simple question 'do pore surface fluctuations enhance or diminish transport?' is surprisingly difficult to answer. While surface fluctuations are naively expected to enhance diffu-sive transport via induced hydrodynamic flows, which underlies the canonical Taylor-Aris mechanism 19,20 , geometrical bulges may entrap particles, resulting in entropic slowing down, as captured by the Fick-Jacobs framework 21,22 , sketched in Fig. 1d. The more general situation of transport with temporally varying geometry remains open despite its obvious importance. In this paper, we establish a general relationship between diffu-sive transport and the dynamical spectrum of surface fluctuations. Our framework applies to the case where structural fluctuations of the confining pore are induced by thermal noise, but crucially also to active, non-equilibrium fluctuations induced by external stimuli. We apply our formalism to several situations relevant to nanopore transport 13,14 , as well as to larger-scale configurations, for example active contractions in fungal species, which influence nutrient transport 17,23,24 ; see Fig. 1a-c. Our theory starts with the perturbative analysis of the diffusion of a particle confined between fluctuating surfaces. For simplicity, we consider the two-dimensional geometry presented in Fig. 1e, but the results and the formalism can readily be extended to three dimensions (Supplementary Information 1). The upper surface is located at z = H + h(x, t), where H is the mean height and h(x, t) represents fluctuations about this mean (x represents the coordinate along the channel and z the height coordinate). The tracer particle for instance, a molecule of dye in the fluid-locally diffuses with a bare diffusion constant D 0 and is advected by a hydrodynamic flow u. The probability density p(x, z, t) of the particle obeys the Fokker-Planck (or Smoluchowski) equation: ∂ t p = − ∇⋅ (up) + D 0 $\Delta$ p. At this stage, the convective degrees of freedom arising from the membrane fluctuations are not averaged out and explicitly enter the Fokker-Planck equation. The Fokker-Planck equation is valid as long as the timescales associated with the tracer position are larger than the microscopic relaxation timescales, and we can verify that this timescale separation assumption holds in practice down to molecular confinement 25. In the case of thin channels, a standard expansion (Supplementary Information 1 and 2) yields a reduced advection diffusion equation for the marginal probability density p x t (,) * = + p x z t z (, ,) d H h x t 0 (,)},

The nature of the dynamics is further explored by computing the propagation of mutual information with respect to varying partitions.

abstract = {We study the R{\'{e}}nyi entanglement entropy of an interval in a periodic fermionic chain for a general eigenstate of a free, translational invariant Hamiltonian. In order to analytically compute the entropy we use two technical tools. The first is used to logarithmically reduce the complexity of the problem and the second to compute the R{\'{e}}nyi entropy of the chosen subsystem. We introduce new strategies to perform the computations, derive new expressions for the entropy of these general states and show the perfect agreement of the analytical computations and the numerical outcome. Finally we discuss the physical interpretation of our results and generalize them to compute the entanglement entropy for a fragment of a fermionic ladder.},

(2) The Hamiltonian describes a nearest neighbor spin-spin interaction. More precisely, we have H = JN 4 − J i S i {\textperiodcentered} S i+1 , S N +1 = S 1 . (3) Let us introduce the usual raising and lowering operators S ± = S x ± iS y , such that S + | ↑↑ = 0, S − | ↑↑ = | ↓↓, S z | ↑↑ = 1 2 | ↑↑ S + | ↓↓ = | ↑↑, S − | ↓↓ = 0, S z | ↓↓ = − 1 2 | ↓↓. (4) Then we can rewrite the Hamiltonian as H = JN 4 − J i 1 2 (S + i S − i+1 + S − i S + i+1) + S z i S z i+1 . (5) Let us look at the different terms. The terms involving S ± are called hopping terms since they move a spin up or spin down to a neighboring site. The constant term proportional to N is added for convenience. It is simply an overall shift of the energy levels. Depending on the sign, you want to align or anti-align the spins. Hence this is a rudimentary model of (ferro)magnetism. Written out in components, the Hamiltonian is a special case of a more general Hamiltonian which takes the form z i+1). (6) This model is usually called the XYZ spin chain. In case J x = J y it is called the XXZ spin chain and our model is referred to as the XXX spin chain. Notice that the size of the Hamiltonian is 2 N × 2 N and hence for large systems it is pretty much impossible to diagonalize it by brute force. In order to determine the spectrum you have to think of a different way. Furthermore, to deal with the physically interesting N → ∞ limit, the spectrum has to be understood with some analytic methods.},

abstract = {The observation of the spin Hall eeect 1–3 triggered intense research on pure spin current transport 4 . With the spin Hall eeect 1,2,5,6 , the spin Seebeck eeect 7–9 and the spin Peltier ef-fect 10,11 already observed, our picture of pure spin current transport is almost complete. The only missing piece is the spin Nernst (–Ettingshausen) eeect, which so far has been discussed only on theoretical grounds 12–15 . Here, we report the observation of the spin Nernst eeect. By applying a longitudinal temperature gradient, we generate a pure transverse spin cur-rent in a Pt thin film. For readout, we exploit the magnetization-orientation-dependent spin transfer to an adjacent yttrium iron garnet layer, converting the spin Nernst current in Pt into a con-trolled change of the longitudinal and transverse thermopower voltage. Our experiments show that the spin Nernst and the spin Hall eeect in Pt are of comparable magnitude, but diier in sign, as corroborated by first-principles calculations. Transverse transport is a key aspect of charge and/or spin motion in the solid state. In the charge channel, the Hall effect 16 and the Nernst effect 17 sketched in Fig. 1a,b enshrine transverse charge motion due to a gradient in the longitudinal potential imposed by an electric or thermal stimulus, respectively. Since the magnitude of the Hall charge current j Hall c ∝ $\theta$ H j c × H (parameterized by the Hall angle $\theta$ H , the applied charge current j c and the external magnetic field H) is governed by the density of mobile charge carriers in simple metals and semiconductors, Hall effect experiments quickly became a standard tool for material characterization. As sketched in Fig. 1b, the transverse Nernst charge current j Nernst c ∝ $\theta$ N ∇T × H is driven by a temperature gradient ∇T or the corresponding heat current j h = −$\kappa$∇T , where $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity and $\theta$ N is the Nernst angle. While first experiments in the spirit of the spin Hall effect were conducted in the 1970s (ref. 18), only recently, electrically driven transverse spin transport in the form of the spin Hall effect (SHE) 19,20 resulted in a new paradigm for spin-electronic device design 3,4,21 .

@article{Oriti,
abstract = {We construct condensate states encoding the continuum spherically symmetric quantum geometry of a horizon in full quantum gravity, i.e., without any classical symmetry reduction, in the group field theory formalism. Tracing over the bulk degrees of freedom, we show how the resulting reduced density matrix manifestly exhibits a holographic behavior. We derive a complete orthonormal basis of eigenstates for the reduced density matrix of the horizon and use it to compute the horizon entanglement entropy. By imposing consistency with the horizon boundary conditions and semiclassical thermodynamical properties, we recover the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for any value of the Immirzi parameter. Our analysis supports the equivalence between the von Neumann (entanglement) entropy interpretation and the Boltzmann (statistical) one. Introduction.—In this Letter we build and analyze, for the first time, spherically symmetric continuum states to model a quantum black hole horizon, working in the full theory. In doing so, we make no reference to a classical symmetry-reduced sector [1]. As quantum gravity states for continuum spherically symmetric geometries we use spin network condensates in the group field theory (GFT) formalism [2,3], a framework in which the concepts and tools of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and spinfoam models are implemented and extended in a second quantized language. We impose on them conditions characterizing horizons, and analyze their entanglement properties. We show that their entanglement entropy coincides with the Boltzmann entropy of horizon degrees of freedom (DOF) and it satisfies an area law, a cornerstone of holography. The major strength of our analysis is the possibility of taking into account the sum over triangulations required in the coarse graining procedure leading to an effective macroscopic description, as well as the control over the interplay between horizon boundary conditions and the calculation of entropy. In fact, we are able to control the states with a relatively small number of parameters, encoding the geometrical data of the continuum geometry: we are using hydrodynamic states. This construction allows us to explicitly compute the horizon density matrix and to prove the holographic nature of our states. The implications of these novel features are striking. The entanglement entropy can be computed exactly and it matches the Bekenstein-Hawking formula [4] for any value of the Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ (see [5–7] for a discussion on $\gamma$), once consistency with semiclassical conditions is imposed. The calculation reduces to a state counting, with the microscopic DOF encoded in the combinatorial structure of all possible horizon condensate graphs (for a fixed macroscopic area value). This supports the equivalence between entanglement and statistical interpretations of black hole entropy suggested in [6]. Because of difficulties in extracting effective equations of motion for our generalized GFT condensates from the fundamental dynamics of a given GFT model, we will omit restrictions originating from the microscopic dynamics in this work. However, we will rely on the use a maximum entropy principle to capture a few essential dynamical features, and as a partial characterization of horizon geometries, and we will show the consequence of requiring the compatibility with the classical dynamics of horizons and their thermodynamical properties. Construction.—Our plan consists of the following steps. (i) We define GFT condensate states (as constructed in [3]) for a spacelike, spherically symmetric geometry by acting with a class of refinement operators on a seed state, and with appropriate semiclassicality restrictions. (ii) We derive the reduced density matrix, tracing away the remaining bulk DOF and find a complete orthonormal basis of its eigenstates. (iii) We compute the entanglement entropy, coinciding with the statistical entropy of the boundary DOF, and show how the result is affected by different choices of boundary conditions. Spherically symmetric quantum states.—We define a spherical symmetric quantum geometry in terms of a gluing of homogeneous spherical shells to one another [3]. The states of each shell are constructed starting from a seed state for a given shell, upon which we act with refinement operators, increasing the number of vertices and keeping the topology fixed as the connectivity is changed. In this way, the GFT state for a given shell is given by a (possibly infinite) superposition of regular 4-valent graphs with given topology. Shells are then glued together to form a full 3D foliation.},

abstract = {Quantum mechanics predicts that measurements of incompatible observables carry a minimum uncertainty which is independent of technical deficiencies of the measurement apparatus or incomplete knowledge of the state of the system. Nothing yet seems to prevent a single physical quantity, such as one spin component, from being measured with arbitrary precision. Here, we show that an intrinsic quantum uncertainty on a single observable is ineludible in a number of physical situations. When revealed on local observables of a bipartite system, such uncertainty defines an entire class of bona fide measures of nonclassical correlations. For the case of 2?d systems, we find that a unique measure is defined, which we evaluate in closed form. We then discuss the role that these correlations, which are of the ‘‘discord'' type, can play in the context of quantum metrology. We show in particular that the amount of discord present in a bipartite mixed probe state guarantees a minimum precision, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, in the optimal phase estimation protocol.},

abstract = {A remarkable yet mysterious property of black holes is that their entropy is proportional to the horizon area. This area law inspired the holographic principle, which was later realized concretely in gauge-gravity duality. In this context, entanglement entropy is given by the area of a minimal surface in a dual spacetime. However, discussions of area laws have been constrained to entanglement entropy, whereas a full understanding of a quantum state requires R{\'{e}}nyi entropies. Here we show that all R{\'{e}}nyi entropies satisfy a similar area law in holographic theories and are given by the areas of dual cosmic branes. This geometric prescription is a one-parameter generalization of the minimal surface prescription for entanglement entropy. Applying this we provide the first holographic calculation of mutual R{\'{e}}nyi information between two disks of arbitrary dimension. Our results provide a framework for efficiently studying R{\'{e}}nyi entropies and understanding entanglement structures in strongly coupled systems and quantum gravity.},

The transition to an unstable absorbing state is described by a change in the sign of the kinetic term in the Floquet Hamiltonian and controlled by the short-wavelength degrees of freedom.

While the ES could be, at least in principle, measured by full quantum state tomography of $\rho$ A , this is exponentially inefficient with system size. Here, we propose to shift the paradigm of measuring entanglement properties, from a probing of the wavefunction (see, for example, refs 15,16) to a direct and efficient quantum simulation and spectroscopy of the corresponding EH. The challenge is, therefore , to develop techniques, accessible in the present experiments, that provide a direct realization of the EH. Below we address this problem, building on the Bisognano-Wichmann (BW) theorem 17,18 of axiomatic quantum field theory, in the framework of many-body quantum systems. As we argue below, the implementantion of the EH is feasible on a variety of experimental settings, including atoms in optical lattices, trapped ions and arrays of Rydberg atoms, and it requires only already demonstrated experimental techniques. The BW theorem provides a closed-form expression for the EH H A for Lorentz invariant quantum field theories. This theorem states that, given a system with Hamiltonian density H x () and a half-bipartition A of the infinite plane (which, for simplicity, we denote as the subspace with x 1 {\textgreater} 0), the EH of the ground state of H reads = = + H x H c x x 2 d (()) (2) A x A 1 where c′ is a constant to guarantee the unit trace of the reduced density matrix. The BW construction holds in any dimensions, and in particular provides a simple explicit form for the EH, which-like the original physical Hamiltonian-is built from just local few-body terms and interactions. A key feature of this result is that its applicability does not rely on any knowledge of the ground state, and thus can be applied in both gapped and gapless quantum systems , and also at quantum critical points. Moreover, equation (2) has a clear-cut physical interpretation in terms of entanglement temperature 19-21 : if we interpret $\rho$ A as thermal state, this corresponds to a state of the original Hamiltonian H with respect to a locally varying temperature, very large close to the boundary of A, and linearly decreasing far from it. This interpretation has been used, for example, in the context of Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect 22. Moreover, the BW theorem has been extended to different geometries in the presence of conformal symmetry 19 , and may also incorporate gauge symmetries 23,24. While the BW theorem applies strictly speaking only to the ideal scenario of infinite system size and in the continuum, to establish a connection to condensed-matter systems and atomic physics experiments , we will cast it on finite lattice models. Below, we show how this approach is remarkably accurate for many paradigmatic cases in strongly correlated systems, including conformal phases of both The properties of a strongly correlated many-body quantum system, from the presence of topological order to the onset of quantum criticality, leave a footprint in its entanglement spectrum. The entanglement spectrum is composed by the eigen-values of the density matrix representing a subsystem of the whole original system, but its direct measurement has remained elusive due to the lack of direct experimental probes. Here we show that the entanglement spectrum of the ground state of a broad class of Hamiltonians becomes directly accessible via the quantum simulation and spectroscopy of a suitably constructed entanglement Hamiltonian, building on the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem of axiomatic quantum field theory. This theorem gives an explicit physical construction of the entanglement Hamiltonian, identified as the Hamiltonian of the many-body system of interest with spatially varying couplings. On this basis, we propose a scalable recipe for the measurement of a system's entanglement spectrum via spectroscopy of the corresponding Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian realized in synthetic quantum systems, including atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions. We illustrate and benchmark this scenario on a variety of models, spanning phenomena as diverse as conformal field theories, topological order and quantum phase transitions.},

Here we generalise the quantum finite-state generators by replacing the von Neumann pro jections by stochastic quantum operations. In this way we assure that any time series with a stochastic compressed description has a compressed quantum description. Moreover, we establish a link between our stochastic generators and the sequential readout of many-body states with translationally-invariant matrix product state representations. As an example, we consider the non-adaptive read-out of 1D cluster states. This is shown to be equivalent to a Hidden Quantum Model with two internal states, providing insight on the inherent complexity of the process. Finally, it is proven by example that the quantum description can have a higher degree of compression than the classical stochastic one.},

abstract = {We apply and extend the theory of universal recovery channels from quantum information theory to address the problem of entanglement wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT. It has recently been proposed that any low-energy local bulk operators in a CFT boundary region's entanglement wedge can be reconstructed on that boundary region itself. Existing work arguing for this proposal relies on algebraic consequences of the exact equivalence between bulk and boundary relative entropies, namely the theory of operator algebra quantum error correction. However, bulk and boundary relative entropies are only approximately equal in bulk effective field theory, and in similar situations it is known that predictions from exact entropic equalities can be qualitatively incorrect. The framework of universal recovery channels provides a robust demonstration of the entanglement wedge reconstruction conjecture in addition to new physical insights. Most notably, we find that a bulk operator acting in a given boundary region's entanglement wedge can be expressed as the response of the boundary region's modular Hamiltonian to a perturbation of the bulk state in the direction of the bulk operator. This formula can be interpreted as a noncommutative version of Bayes' rule that attempts to undo the noise induced by restricting to only a portion of the boundary, and has an integral representation in terms of modular flows. We illustrate the application of our formula in the 2+1 dimensional AdS-Rindler case, finding that it expresses local bulk operators in the AdS-Rindler wedge in terms of modes in the corresponding boundary region. To reach these conclusions, we extend the theory of universal recovery channels to finite-dimensional operator algebras and demonstrate that recovery channels approximately preserve the multiplicative structure of the operator algebra.},

abstract = {The characteristic function of the work performed by an external time-dependent force on a Hamiltonian quantum system is identified with the time-ordered correlation function of the exponentiated system's Hamil-tonian. A similar expression is obtained for the averaged exponential work which is related to the free energy difference of equilibrium systems by the Jarzynski work theorem. Deep relations between nonequilibrium fluctuations and thermal equilibrium properties of small systems have recently been discovered and formulated in terms of so-called fluctuation theorems 1,2. These theorems are not only of basic theoretical relevance but provide ground for experimental investigations of small systems in physics, chemistry, and biology 3. In this Rapid Communication we want to preclude a possible confusion about the notion of work in the context of fluctuation theorems for quantum mechanical Hamiltonian systems. To be precise, we consider a quantum system which was in thermal contact with a heat bath at inverse temperature until a time t 0. Then the contact with the bath is switched off and a classical force acts on the otherwise isolated Hamiltonian system until the time t f according to a prescribed protocol. We demonstrate that the exponential average of the total work performed on the system as well as the characteristic function of this work are given by time-ordered correlation functions of the exponentiated Hamil-tonian rather than by expectation values of an operator representing the work as a pretended observable. For a system that evolves under the exclusive influence of a time-dependent Hamiltonian Ht from an initial thermal equilibrium state, 0 = Z0 −1 exp− H0, 1 at time t 0 = 0 until a final time t = t f , the work performed on the system is a randomly distributed quantity w. Its statistical properties follow from a probability density pw or, equivalently , from the corresponding characteristic function Gu, which is defined as the Fourier transform of the probability density, i.e., Gu = dwe iuw pw. 2 We will demonstrate that the characteristic function is given by the following quantum correlation function: Gu = e iuHt f e −iuH0 Tr e iuH H t f e −iuH0 0 = Tr e iuHt f Ut f e −iuH0 0U + t f = Tr e iuHt f Ut f e −iu+H0 U + t f /Z0, 3 where "Tr" denotes the trace over the system's Hilbert space H, Ut the unitary time evolution governed by the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation iUt / t = HtUt with U0 =1, and H H t = U + tHtUt is the Hamiltonian in the Heisen-berg picture. The third equality follows from the second line by the cyclic invariance of the trace and the last line follows with Eq. 1. The characteristic function has the form of a time-ordered correlation function of the two operators expiuHt f and exp−iuH0. We note that this correlation function in general differs from the averaged exponential of the difference of the Hamiltonians W = H H t f − H0, which sometimes is referred to as the operator of work 4. It is possible though to formally rewrite the characteristic function in terms of the difference between the Hamiltonians. In the second line of Eq. 3 the product of the operators expiuH H t and exp−iuH0 occurs in chronological order and may be written as expiuH H texp−iuH0 = T expiuH H t exp−iuH0. Under the protection of the time ordering operator T the usual rule for exponentials of commutative quantities holds 5 to yield the following equivalent forms of the characteristic function of work Gu = Tr T e iuH H t f −H0 0 = Tr T exp iu 0 t f H H s s ds 0. 4 The second equality is a consequence of the known fact that the total derivative of the Hamiltonian in the Heisenberg picture coincides with its partial time derivative. The averaged exponentiated work exp−w is obtained from the characteristic function by putting u = i, cf. Eq. 2. Using the correlation function expression 3 together with the canonical initial density matrix 1 we immediately recover the Jarzynski equation in its known form 6, e −w = Zt f Z0 , 5 where Zt f =Tr e −Ht f is the partition function of a hypothetical system with Hamiltonian Ht f in a Gibbs state at inverse temperature. By replacing the quantum correlation function by the corresponding correlation function of a classical Hamiltonian system the characteristic function of the work performed on the classical system is obtained. Its inverse Fourier transform yields the known classical expression for the probability density of work, cf. Ref. 7, PHYSICAL REVIEW E 75, 050102R 2007},

The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the dierences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that the GGE describes spin–spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.},

abstract = {We review a general theory of thermodynamics of information processing. The background of this topic is the recently-developed nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum (and classical) information theory. These theories are closely related to the modern technologies to manipulate and observe small systems; for example, macromolecules and colloidal particles in the classical regime, and quantum-optical systems and quantum dots in the quantum regime. First, we review a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics to the situations in which small thermodynamic systems are subject to quantum feedback control. The generalized second law is expressed in terms of an inequality that includes the term of information obtained by the measurement, as well as the thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy. This inequality leads to the fundamental upper bound of the work that can be extracted by a "Maxwell's demon", which can be regarded as a feedback controller with a memory that stores measurement outcomes. Second, we review generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics to the measurement and information erasure processes of the memory of the demon that is a quantum system. The generalized second laws consist of inequalities that identify the lower bounds of the energy costs that are needed for the measurement and the information erasure. The inequality for the erasure leads to the celebrated Landauer's principle for a special case. Moreover, these inequalities enable us to reconcile Maxwell's demon with the second law of thermodynamics. In these inequalities, thermodynamic quantities and information contents are treated on an equal footing. In fact, the inequalities are model-independent, so that they can be applied to a broad class of information processing. Therefore, these inequalities can be called the second law of "information thermodynamics".},

abstract = {We simulate the dynamics of a disordered interacting spin chain subject to a quasiperiodic time-dependent drive, corresponding to a stroboscopic Fibonacci sequence of two distinct Hamiltonians. Exploiting the recursive drive structure, we can efficiently simulate exponentially long times. After an initial transient, the system exhibits a long-lived glassy regime characterized by a logarithmically slow growth of entanglement and decay of correlations analogous to the dynamics at the many-body delocalization transition. Ultimately, at long time scales, which diverge exponentially for weak or rapid drives, the system thermalizes to infinite temperature. The slow relaxation enables metastable dynamical phases, exemplified by a " time quasicrystal " in which spins exhibit persistent oscillations with a distinct quasiperiodic pattern from that of the drive. We show that in contrast with Floquet systems, a high-frequency expansion strictly breaks down above fourth order, and fails to produce an effective static Hamiltonian that would capture the prethermal glassy relaxation.},

Recent theoretical studies have revealed that thermalization in isolated quantum systems has several remarkable features, which emerge from quantum entanglement and are quite distinct from those in classical systems. Experimentally, well isolated and highly controllable ultracold quantum gases offer an ideal testbed to study the nonequilibrium dynamics in isolated quantum systems, promoting intensive recent theoretical endeavors on this fundamental subject. Besides thermalization, many isolated quantum systems show intriguing behavior in relaxation processes, especially prethermalization. Prethermalization occurs when there is a clear separation of relevant time scales and has several different physical origins depending on individual systems. In this review, we overview theoretical approaches to the problems of thermalization and prethermalization.},

@article{Reimann2018a,
abstract = {We consider the set of all initial states within a microcanonical energy shell of an isolated many-body quantum system, which exhibit an arbitrary but fixed nonequilibrium expectation value for some given observable A. On the condition that this set is not too small, it is shown by means of a dynamical typicality approach that most such initial states exhibit thermalization if and only if A satisfies the so-called weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (wETH). Here, thermalization means that the expectation value of A spends most of its time close to the microcanonical value after initial transients have died out. The wETH means that, within the energy shell, most eigenstates of the pertinent system Hamiltonian exhibit very similar expectation values of A. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a pivotal role in numerous recent investigations of thermal-ization in isolated many-body quantum systems [1,2], comparable to the role of the ergodic hypothesis in the classical realm. In essence, the ETH postulates that energy eigenstates with sufficiently close energy eigenvalues exhibit very similar expectation values [3-6]. It is generally taken for granted that the ETH guarantees thermalization for any initial state with a macroscopically well-defined system energy. Whether the ETH is also necessary for thermalization is a question of considerable current interest [2,7-13]. Here, we will provide examples implying that the ETH (in its most common version) should be considered neither as sufficient nor as necessary for thermalization without any further specification of the admitted initial states. Accordingly, we will focus on a suitable subset of initial states, namely, all pure states which exhibit the same arbitrary but fixed initial expectation value for some given observable A. In the most common case, this subset is still "reasonably large" (in a mathematically precisely defined sense) and entails quite remarkable dynamical typicality and concentration of measure properties, as detailed in Refs. [14,15]. Here, we further develop these concepts and show that a "weak" version of the ETH [16-20] is both necessary and sufficient in order that the vast majority of those initial states exhibit thermalization with respect to the observable A at hand. Whether or not a given system thermalizes and whether or not it satisfies the ETH are very important issues in themselves, but they are not at the focus of our present work. Rather, our main focus is on how the two issues are connected. Based on related preliminary conjectures [21,22], the ETH was originally proposed in the context of chaotic systems in the semiclassical limit [4,5]; see also [23-26]. In fact, for so-called macroscopic observables, the ETH is already buried in von Neumann's work [27,28], as pointed out in Refs. [8,29-31]. More recent analytical investigations of the ETH often focus on (sums of) local observ-ables, subsystems in contact with a heat bath, spatially discrete lattice models, or Hamiltonians with bound spectra [7,9,10,12,16]. In view of the quite extensive numerical explorations [1,2] and of Deutsch's results based on random matrix theory [3,32], this Letter pursues the standpoint that the ETH is an interesting and relevant concept beyond any such particular class of systems and observables. As usual [1,2], the isolated many-body system is described by a Hamiltonian H with discrete eigenvalues E n and eigenvectors jni. Focusing on an arbitrary but fixed microcanonical energy interval [E − ϵ, E], the number of energies E n in this interval is denoted by N, and we choose the indices so that n ∈ f1; {\ldots}; Ng for all those E n 's. The width ϵ is assumed to be small on the macroscopic scale (well-defined system energy) but large on the microscopic scale. For many-body systems with f ≫ 1 degrees of freedom, N is then exponentially large in f [28]. The energy eigenstates fjnig N n¼1 span a Hilbert space H, called the microcanonical energy shell. Considering any given j$\psi$i ∈ H as an initial state j$\psi$ð0Þi, it evolves in time according to j$\psi$ðtÞi ¼ U t j$\psi$i with U t ≔ e −iHt=ℏ , yielding for an arbitrary observable A the expectation value h$\psi$ðtÞjAj$\psi$ðtÞi ¼ h$\psi$jA t j$\psi$i; ð1Þ A t ≔ U † t AU t ¼ X N m;n¼1 A mn e iðE m −E n Þt=ℏ jmihnj; ð2Þ where A mn ≔ hmjAjni. In cases where the Hamiltonian H exhibits degeneracies, its eigenvectors jni are chosen so},

Here, we ask if quantum mechanics can fundamentally change the qualitative behaviour of this measure. We study this question in the context of the classical Ising spin chain. In this system, the statistical complexity is known to grow monotonically with temperature. We evaluate the spin chain's quantum mechanical statistical complexity by explicitly constructing its provably simplest quantum model, and demonstrate that this measure exhibits drastically different behaviour: it rises to a maximum at some finite temperature then tends back towards zero for higher temperatures. This demonstrates how complexity, as captured by the amount of memory required to model a process, can exhibit radically different behaviour when quantum processing is allowed.},

In particular, in the two-dimensional case in the classical (long time) regime, we find that the dynamics of decoherence is universal, exhibiting a power-law decay with an exponent, proportional to the ratio of the temperature to the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature of a single 2D condensate. In the one-dimensional case in the classical regime we find a universal nonanalytic time dependence of decoherence, which is a consequence of the nonhydrodynamic nature of damping in 1D liquids.},

Nevertheless, by dynamically splitting the condensate into two parallel decoupled tubes the system can be prepared with a macroscopic relative phase, facilitating interferometric measurement. Here, we describe a dephasing mechanism whereby the quantum-phase fluctuations, which are so effective in equilibrium, act to destroy the macroscopic relative phase that was imposed as a nonequilibrium initial condition. We show that the phase coherence between the condensates decays exponentially with a dephasing time that depends on intrinsic parameters: the interaction strength, sound velocity, and density. Interestingly, significant temperature dependence appears only above a cross-over scale T*. In contrast to the usual phase diffusion, which is essentially an effect of confinement and leads to Gaussian decay, the exponential dephasing caused by fluctuations is a bulk effect that survives the thermodynamic limit.},

Of course, isolated systems are by nature finite and the main way of computing such quantities is through numerical evaluation for finite-size systems. Therefore, the finite-size scaling of the fluctuations of eigenstate expectation values is a central aspect of the ETH. In this work, we present numerical evidence that for generic nonintegrable systems these fluctuations scale with a universal power law D −1/2 with the dimension D of the Hilbert space. We provide heuristic arguments, in the same spirit as the ETH, to explain this universal result. Our results are based on the analysis of three families of models and several observables for each model. Each family includes integrable members and we show how the system size where the universal power law becomes visible is affected by the proximity to integrability.},

abstract = {Using the concept of open systems where a classical geometry is treated as the system and quantum matter Gelds as the environment, we derive a Buctuation-dissipation theorem for semiclas-sical cosmology. This theorem, which exists under very general conditions for dissipations in the dynamics of the system, and the noise and Buctuations in the environment, can be traced to the formal mathematical relation between the dissipation and noise kernels of the inBuence functional depicting the open system, and is ultimately a consequence of the unitarity of the closed system. In particular, for semiclassical gravity, it embodies the back reaction efFect of matter Gelds on the dynamics of spacetime. The back reaction equation derivable from the inBuence action is in the form of an Einstein-Langevin equation. It contains a dissipative term in the equation of motion for the dynamics of spacetime and a noise term related to the Buctuations of particle creation in the matter Geld. Using the well-studied model of a quantum scalar Geld in a Bianchi type-I universe we illustrate how this Langevin equation and the noise term are derived and show how the creation of particles and the dissipation of anisotropy during the expansion of the universe can be understood as a manifestation of this Buctuation-dissipation relation.

Two condensates separated by approximately 40 micrometers were created by evaporatively cooling sodium atoms in a double-well potential formed by magnetic and optical forces. High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of approximately 15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are "laser-like"; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations.

@article{Brandao2008,
abstract = {Entanglement is central both to the foundations of quantum theory and, as a novel resource, to quantum information science. The theory of entanglement establishes basic laws that govern its manipulation, in particular the non-increase of entanglement under local operations on the constituent particles. Such laws aim to draw from them formal analogies to the second law of thermodynamics; however, whereas in the second law the entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible from another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits a fundamental irreversibility, which prevents the existence of such an order. Here, we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous relationship with thermodynamics may be established when considering all non-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is taken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of entanglement. We show the usefulness of this approach to general resource theories and to quantum information theory. Thermodynamics is arguably one of the most fundamental and generally applicable theories of nature in which the foundations have remained intact despite the emergence of quantum mechanics, relativity and other physical laws 1 . It was initially understood to describe the physics of large systems in equilibrium, determining their bulk properties by a very simple set of rules of universal character. This was reflected in the formulation of the defining axiom of thermodynamics, the second law, by Clausius, Kelvin and Planck in terms of quasi-static processes and heat exchange. However, the apparently universal applicability of the theory suggested a deeper mathematical and structural foundation. Indeed, there is a long history of examinations of the foundations underlying the second law. Of particular interest in the present context is the work of Giles 2 and notably Lieb and Yngvason 3 stating that there exists a complete order for equilibrium thermodynamical states that determines which state transformations are possible by means of an adiabatic process. From simple, abstract, axioms they were able to show that this order is uniquely determined by an entropy function S: given two equilibrium states A and B, A can be converted by an adiabatic process to B if, and only if, S(A) ≤ S(B). As pointed out by Lieb and Yngvason 4 , it is a strength of this abstract approach that it enables us to uncover a thermodynamical structure in settings that may at first appear unrelated. One such possible setting is the theory of entanglement 5,6},

@article{Sagawa2008,
abstract = {A new thermodynamic inequality is derived which leads to the maximum work that can be extracted from multi-heat-baths with the assistance of discrete quantum feedback control. The maximum work is determined by the free-energy difference and a generalized mutual information content between the thermodynamic system and the feedback controller. This maximum work can exceed that in conventional thermodynamics and, in the case of a heat cycle with two heat baths, the heat efficiency can be greater than that of the Carnot cycle. The consistency of our results with the second law of thermodynamics is ensured by the fact that work is needed for information processing of the feedback controller. Among a large number of studies conducted on the relationship between thermodynamics and information processing [1-15], particularly provoking is the work of Szilard [2] who argued that positive work W ext can be extracted from an isothermal cycle if Maxwell's demon plays the role of a feedback controller [7]. It is now well understood that the role of the demon does not contradict the second law of thermodynamics, because the initializa-tion of the demon's memory entails heat dissipation [3-5]. We note that, in the case of an isothermal process, the second law of thermodynamics can be expressed as W ext {\"{y}}F S ; (1) where F S is the difference in the Helmholtz free energy between the initial and final thermodynamic equilibrium states. In a different context, quantum feedback control has attracted considerable attention for controlling and stabilizing a quantum system [16-22]. It can be applied, for example, to squeezing an electromagnetic field [18], spin squeezing [20], and stabilizing macroscopic coherence [22]. While the theoretical framework of quantum feedback control as a stochastic dynamic system is well developed , the possible thermodynamic gain of quantum feedback control has yet to be fully understood. In this Letter, we derive a new thermodynamic inequality which sets the fundamental limit on the work that can be extracted from multi-heat-baths with discrete quantum feedback control [7,23], consisting of quantum measurement [23,24] and a mechanical operation depending on the measurement outcome. The maximum work is characterized by a generalized mutual information content between the thermodynamic system and the feedback controller. We shall refer to this as the QC-mutual information content, where QC indicates that the measured system is quantal and that the measurement outcome is classical. The QC-mutual information content reduces to the classical mutual information content [25] in the case of classical measurement. In the absence of feedback control, the new inequality (17) reduces to the Clausius inequality. In the case of an isothermal process, its upper bound exceeds that of inequality (1) by an amount proportional to the QC-mutual information content. We consider a thermodynamic process for system S which can contact heat baths B 1 ; B 2 ;. .. ; B n at respective temperatures T 1 ; T 2 ;. .. ; T n. We assume that system S is in thermodynamic equilibrium in the initial and final states. For simplicity, we also assume that the initial and final temperature of S is given by T k B  {\"{y}}1. This can be realized by contacting S with, for example, B 1 in the preparation of the initial state and during equilibration to the final state; in this case T  T 1. We do not, however, assume that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium between the initial and final states. We assume that system S and heat baths B m are as a whole isolated and that they only come into contact with some external mechanical systems and the feedback controller. Apart from the feedback controller, the total Hamiltonian can be written as {\^{}} Ht  {\^{}} H S t  X n m1  {\^{}} H SB m t  {\^{}} H B m ; (2) where {\^{}} H SB m t is the interaction Hamiltonian between system S and heat bath B m. The Hamiltonian {\^{}} H S t describes a mechanical operation on S through such external parameters as an applied magnetic field or volume of the gas, and the Hamiltonian {\^{}} H SB m t describes, for example, the attachment (detachment) of an adiabatic wall or B m to (from) S. We consider a time evolution from t i to t f , assume {\^{}} H SB m t i   {\^{}} H SB m t f   0 for all m, and write {\^{}} H S t i   {\^{}} H S i and {\^{}} H S t f   {\^{}} H S f. The time evolution of the total system with discrete quantum feedback control can be divided into the following five stages: Stage 1 (Initial state).-At time t i , the initial state of S and that of B m are in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperatures T and T m , respectively. We assume that the density operator of the entire state is given by the canonical PRL 100, 080403 (2008) P H Y S I C A L},

Here, we show that an intrinsic quantum uncertainty on a single observable is ineludible in a number of physical situations. When revealed on local observables of a bipartite system, such uncertainty defines an entire class of bona fide measures of nonclassical correlations. For the case of 2 {\^{A}} d systems, we find that a unique measure is defined, which we evaluate in closed form. We then discuss the role that these correlations, which are of the ''discord'' type, can play in the context of quantum metrology. We show in particular that the amount of discord present in a bipartite mixed probe state guarantees a minimum precision, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, in the optimal phase estimation protocol.},

@article{Campisi2015,
abstract = {A question that is currently highly debated is whether the microcanonical entropy should be expressed as the logarithm of the phase volume (volume entropy, also known as the Gibbs entropy) or as the logarithm of the density of states (surface entropy, also known as the Boltzmann entropy). Rather than postulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is customary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy expression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental thermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for quasistatic processes: $\delta$Q/T is an exact differential, and (ii) the law of ideal gases: P V = k B NT . The first pillar implies that entropy must be some function of the phase volume . The second pillar singles out the logarithmic function among all possible functions. Hence the construction leads uniquely to the expression S = k B ln , that is, the volume entropy. As a consequence any entropy expression other than that of Gibbs, e.g., the Boltzmann entropy, can lead to inconsistencies with the two thermodynamic pillars. We illustrate this with the prototypical example of a macroscopic collection of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field, and show that the Boltzmann entropy severely fails to predict the magnetization, even in the thermodynamic limit. The uniqueness of the Gibbs entropy, as well as the demonstrated potential harm of the Boltzmann entropy, provide compelling reasons for discarding the latter at once.},

@article{Carr,
abstract = {T he quantum transport of charge is a prominent feature in emerging models for future technologies, from micro-processors in computing to radical ideas for renewable-energy materials. In general, transport describes the motion of matter that has sufficient energy to overcome barriers, in contrast to quantum tunnelling, which occurs directly through barriers. Such transport becomes 'quantum' when the wave-like nature of particles is required to describe the process. There are different types of quantum trans-port, and devices that turn such flows on and off are called field-effect transistors (FETs) 1 and are a mainstay of micro processor technol-ogy. In this issue, Stadler et al. 2 demonstrate a micrometre-scale FET that is able to capture the dynamics of quantum transport in a regime called strongly correlated quantum-coherent superfluidity. Their contribution can best be explained by tracking how different FETs can be used to study the dynamics of charge in a progression of transport regimes. The basic concept of a FET is to use an electric field (gate) to control the transport of electrons or holes (notional particles formed by the absence of electrons) through a nar-row channel between two charge reservoirs (source and drain) in a semiconducting mater ial. Quantum mechanics must be used to predict the overall behaviour of the collec-tion of charges, but the motion of each parti-cle amounts to a (biased) random walk. The particles' dynamics is modelled by the semi-classical Boltzmann equation. However, under certain conditions, the wave-like nature of the charges becomes a major feature of transport properties. Then, different scattering paths can interfere like waves, building up construc-tive and destructive interference patterns, for instance, and the semi-classical Boltzmann equation is no longer correct. On the edge of this transport regime, a blend of particle and wave-like dynamics is observed. Such partially coherent dynamics is currently being explored 3–5 , for example to efficiently move charges in solar-cell materials and in the latest molecular-electronics devices (Fig. 1a,b).

abstract = {This work is dedicated to those who are genuinely interested in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics is a very successful theory. The founda-tions on which it is based are radically different from the foundations of Newtonian mechanics. Probability and the law of large numbers are its fundamental ingredients. In this paper we will see how the statistical mechanical synthesis which incorporates mechanics (deterministic) and probability theory (indeterministic) works. The approach consists of replacing the actual system by a hypothetical ensemble of systems under same external conditions. From the most used prescription of Gibbs, we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly, actual experiments are not done on a hypothet-ical ensemble. They are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these ex-periments take a finite amount of time. Thus, it is usually argued that actual mea-surements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodic hy-pothesis (time averages = phase space averages). The aim of the present review is to show that ergodic hypothesis is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics (with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution for the problem is in the very pecu-liar nature of the macroscopic observables and with a very large number of degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first pointed out by Boltzmann and then more quantitatively by Khinchin. Similar arguments were used by Landau based upon the approximate property of " statistical independence " . We analyze these ideas in detail. We present a critique of the ideas of Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is a con-ceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by-product of the frequency theory of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the probabilities of various microstates are interpreted with Laplace–Bernoulli Theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint). At the end, we critically review various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality approaches) to the foundations of statistical mechanics. The literature on quantum-statistical typicality is organized under four notions (i) kinematical canonical typicality, (ii) dynamical canonical typicality, (iii) kinematical normal typicality, and (iv) dynamical normal typicality. Analogies are seen in the Khinchin's classical approach and in the modern quantum-statistical typicality approaches.

abstract = {We study entanglement and other correlation properties of random states in high-dimensional bipartite systems. These correlations are quantified by parame-ters that are subject to the " concentration of measure " phenomenon, meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive consequence that there exist large sub-spaces in which all pure states are close to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negli-gible distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible compared to the size of the total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic. Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal superdense coding of quantum states.},

abstract = {A universal quantum simulator is a controlled quantum device that reproduces the dynamics of any other many-particle quantum system with short-range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open-system evolution. Here we propose that laser-excited Rydberg atoms in large-spacing optical or magnetic lattices provide an efficient implementation of a universal quantum simulator for spin models involving n-body interactions, including such of higher order. This would allow the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints, such as the Kitaev toric code, colour code and lattice gauge theories with spin-liquid phases. In addition, our approach provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates using auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step through optical pumping. This enables mimicking the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates. L aser-excited Rydberg atoms 1–7 stored in large-spacing optical lattices 8 or magnetic trap arrays 9 offer unique possibilities for implementing scalable quantum information processors. In such a set-up single atoms can be loaded and kept effectively frozen at each lattice site, with long-lived atomic ground states representing qubits or effective spin degrees of freedom. Lattice spacings of the order of a few micrometres allow single-site addressing with laser light, and thus individual manipulation and readout of atomic spins. Exciting atoms with lasers to high-lying Rydberg states and exploiting the strong and long-range dipole– dipole or van der Waals interactions between Rydberg states provides fast and addressable two-qubit entangling operations or effective spin–spin interactions; recent theoretical proposals have extended Rydberg-based protocols towards a single step, high-fidelity entanglement of a mesoscopic number of atoms 10,11 . Remarkably, the basic building blocks behind such a set-up have been demonstrated recently in the laboratory by several groups 12,13 . Motivated by and building on these new experimental possibili-ties, we discuss below a Rydberg quantum simulator for many-body spin models. As a key ingredient of our set-up (see Fig. 1) we introduce extra auxiliary qubit atoms in the lattice, which have a twofold role. First, they control and mediate effective n-body spin interactions among a subset of n system spins residing in their neighbourhood of the lattice. In our scheme this is achieved efficiently, making use of single-site addressability and a parallelized multi-qubit gate, which is based on a combination of strong and long-range Rydberg interactions and electromagnetically induced transparency, as suggested recently in ref. 11. Second, the auxiliary atoms can be optically pumped, thereby providing a dissipative element, which in combination with Rydberg interactions results in effective collective dissipative dynamics of a set of spins located in the vicinity of the auxiliary particle, which itself eventually factors out from the system spin dynamics. The resulting coherent and dis-sipative dynamics on the lattice can be represented by, and thus sim-ulates a master equation ˙ $\rho$ = −(i/ ¯ h)[H ,$\rho$]+L$\rho$ (ref. 14), where the Hamiltonian H = [ $\alpha$ H $\alpha$ is the sum of n-body interaction terms, in-volving a quasi-local collection of spins in the lattice.

Realistic thermal machines may be unable to cope with arbitrarily large fluctuations. Hence, it is important to understand how thermodynamic efficiency rates are modified by bounding fluctuations. We quantify the work content and work of formation of arbitrary finite dimensional quantum states when the fluctuations in work are bounded by a given amount c. By varying c we interpolate between the standard and minimum free energies. We derive fundamental trade-offs between the magnitude of work and its fluctuations.

The QET is a precise formulation of what we call normal typicality, i.e. the statement that, for typical large systems, every initial wave function j 0 from an energy shell is 'normal': it evolves in such a way that |j t j t | is, for most t, macroscopically equivalent to the micro-canonical density matrix. The QET has been mostly forgotten after it was criticized as a dynamically vacuous statement in several papers in the 1950s. However, we point out that this criticism does not apply to the actual QET, a correct statement of which does not appear in these papers, but to a different (indeed weaker) statement. Furthermore, we formulate a stronger statement of normal typicality, based on the observation that the bound on the deviations from the average specified by von Neumann is unnecessarily coarse and a much tighter (and more relevant) bound actually follows from his proof.},

abstract = {We present a fluctuation theorem for quantum bipartite systems in which the subsystems exchange information with each other. Our information fluctuation theorem includes correlations by introducing a quantum mechanical mutual information content and a statistical probability distribution which allows one to consider statistical averages when computing the thermodynamic and informational quantities. The fundamental limit of heat transferred from a heat reservoir for quantum bipartite systems involving the quantum mutual information is then derived. We illustrate the use of our thermodynamic inequality in quantum computing and discuss our results in terms of Landauer's principle. Generalizations of fluctuation relations to different physical scenarios have attracted great interest [1-17]. Recently, the fluctuation theorems describing bipartite systems have been studied in both classical and quantum domains [13-17]. In particular, studies have shown that the fluctuation theorems are described by work fluctuations with feedback controls based on an information exchange between a system and a memory [13-15], or heat fluctuations with an information exchange between two subsystems [17], or entropy production with an information exchange between two subsystems [15, 16]. In the fluctuation theorems for quantum bipartite systems , however, arbitrary initial states have not been considered. The previous works have assumed that the initial state starts in a product state or a classically correlated state. Moreover, the statistics of the information-thermodynamic quantities in the fluctuation theorems are typically obtained by performing a measurement on the subsystems at the initial and the final times, during the standard two-point measurement protocol (TMP) [5, 6, 9, 11, 12]. For arbitrary quantum bipartite states, the resulting information fluctuation theorems with the TMP do not exhibit the quantum mechanical features of correlations between the subsystems because the initial measurement destroys correlations. In this Letter, we show how the fluctuation theorem for arbitrary bipartite systems can be generalized to involve all the quantum mechanical features. To this end, we consider statistics of the information-thermodynamic quantities with respect to the TMP by measuring the state of the total system, involving probability distributions for the subsystems at the initial time and the final time. In addition, the quantum mechanical mutual information content is introduced, manipulating both the total and the subsystems. The statistical average of the information-thermodynamic quantities leads us to a new thermodynamic inequality for heat transferred from a heat reservoir, which is bound by the entropy change of subsystems and the change of the quantum mutual information between the subsystems. We discuss our results in an instance of quantum computing and in accordance with the thermodynamic relations obtained elsewhere in the literature. We start by considering a non-equilibrium process for a bipartite system $\rho$ AB ∈ H A ⊗ H B comprised of two subsystems, A and B with $\rho$ A ∈ H A and $\rho$ B ∈ H B , and a reservoir $\rho$ R. An arbitrary quantum bipartite state $\rho$ i AB initially decoupled from $\rho$ i R evolves into a final state $\rho$ f ABR = U $\rho$ i AB ⊗ $\rho$ i R U † , where the process is described by a unitary operator U. We assume the initial state of R to be a thermal equilibrium state $\rho$ i R = e −$\beta$HR /Z $\beta$ with an inverse temperature $\beta$ and the corresponding partition function Z $\beta$ , where H R is the Hamiltonian of R. The density operators of each subsystem are given by the partial trace of the bipartite state, i.e, $\rho$ A(B) = Tr B(A) ($\rho$ AB). The spectral decompositions of AB, A, B, R at the initial time t i are denoted as $\rho$ i AB = m p m |mm|, $\rho$ i A = a p a |aa|, $\rho$ i B = b p b |bb|, and $\rho$ i R = r p r |rr|, respectively. In addition, at the final time t f , the spectral decomposition of the states are given by $\rho$ f AB = Tr R ($\rho$ f ABR) = m ′ p m ′ |m ′ m ′ |,$\rho$ f A = a ′ p a ′ |a ′ a ′ |, $\rho$ f B = b ′ p b ′ |b ′ b ′ |. Given a joint probability of two random variables, the classical stochastic mutual information J can be defined as J(k, l) := ln[p k,l /p k p l ], where p k and p l are the marginal probabilities of the joint probability p k,l. We define the joint probability as p a,b := b||a|$\rho$ i AB |b|a at t i and p a, ′ b ′ := b ′ ||a ′ |$\rho$ f AB |b ′ |a ′ at t f for subsystems A and B respectively. Hence, the initial and final classical mutual information are given by J i := ln[p a,b /p a p b ] and J f := ln[p a ′ ,b ′ /p a ′ p b ′ ], respectively [15]. The average of J is equal to the classical mutual information},

This article explains how the bound is tested, and its validity is demonstrated in a wide range of examples. A universal relation between geometry and information is thus uncovered. It has yet to be explained. The holographic principle asserts that its origin must lie in the number of fundamental degrees of freedom involved in a unified description of spacetime and matter. It must be manifest in an underlying quantum theory of gravity. This article surveys some successes and challenges in implementing the holographic principle.},

abstract = {Collective organization in matter plays a significant role in its expressed physical properties. Typically, it is detected via an order parameter, appropriately defined for each given system's observed emergent patterns. Recent developments in information theory, however, suggest quantifying collective organization in a system- and phenomenon-agnostic way: decompose the system's thermodynamic entropy density into a localized entropy, that solely contained in the dynamics at a single location, and a bound entropy, that stored in space as domains, clusters, excitations, or other emergent structures. We compute this decomposition and related quantities explicitly for the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the 1D chain, the Bethe lattice with coordination number k=3, and the 2D square lattice, illustrating its generality and the functional insights it gives near and away from phase transitions. In particular, we consider the roles that different spin motifs play (in cluster bulk, cluster edges, and the like) and how these affect the dependencies between spins.},

By looking for initial signs of an instability of the localized phase, we obtain a value for the critical disorder, which we believe should be a lower bound for the true value, that is higher than current best estimates from finite size studies. This implies that most current methods tend to overestimate the extent of the localized phase due to finite size effects making the localized phase appear stable at small length scales. We also study the mobility edge in these systems as a function of energy density, and we find that our conclusion is the same at all examined energies.},

abstract = {Operator quantum error correction is a technique for robustly storing quantum information in the presence of noise. It generalizes the standard theory of quantum error correction, and provides a unified framework for topics such as quantum error correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and noiseless subsystems. This paper develops ͑a͒ easily applied algebraic and information-theoretic conditions that characterize when operator quantum error correction is feasible; ͑b͒ a representation theorem for a class of noise processes that can be corrected using operator quantum error correction; and ͑c͒ generalizations of the coherent information and quantum data processing inequality to the setting of operator quantum error correction. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.75.064304 PACS number͑s͒: 03.67.Lx To develop quantum technologies such as quantum com-puters and quantum communication networks, it will be nec-essary to protect quantum systems against the effects of noise. Considerable progress toward this goal was made in the late 1990s, when a theory of fault-tolerant quantum com-puting was developed ͓1–5͔, based on the theory of quantum error-correcting codes ͓6–10͔. The early theory of quantum error-correcting codes was based on the following ideas. ͑1͒ Quantum information is stored in a subspace A of a larger state space V = A C. A is known as the code space, while V is the state space of the physical system being used to store the information. ͑2͒ Some physically motivated noise process corrupts the physi-cal system. ͑3͒ A recovery step is performed, restoring the original quantum information stored in A. Since its development this theory has been refined and generalized in a variety of ways, notably through the intro-duction of decoherence-free subspaces ͓11–14͔, noiseless subsystems ͓15–17͔, and operator quantum error correction. In particular, the framework of operator quantum error cor-rection ͓18,19͔ provides a single framework integrating and unifying all of these techniques. Operator quantum error correction is based on the follow-ing ideas: ͑1͒ quantum information is stored in a space A which appears as a tensor factor in a subspace of the overall state space, V, i.e., V = ͑A B͒ C; ͑2͒ some physically mo-tivated noise process E corrupts the physical system; ͑3͒ a recovery step is performed, restoring the original encoded quantum information stored in A. The subsystem A is said to be E correctable. Operator quantum error correction is a generalization of standard quantum error correction. Kribs et al. ͓18,19͔ have shown that operator quantum error correction provides a natural framework unifying and generalizing earlier ap-proaches, including standard quantum error correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and noiseless subsystems. Ba-con ͓20͔ has recently exhibited interesting examples in which operator quantum error correction plays a critical role. A stabilizer formalism for operator quantum error correction was presented in ͓21͔. The purpose of this paper is to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for operator quantum error correction. In particular, we obtain a set of algebraic conditions charac-terizing operator quantum error correction. These conditions generalize the well-known conditions for standard quantum error correction ͓8,22͔, which are one basis for the theory of quantum error-correcting codes, enabling the construction of large classes of codes ͓9,23͔. The necessity of these condi-tions for operator quantum error correction was proved in ͓18͔, but the proof of sufficiency was left open. We establish the sufficiency of these conditions, and use the conditions to establish a representation theorem for a class of noise pro-cesses which can be corrected using operator quantum error correction. We also prove a set of information-theoretic conditions characterizing operator quantum error correction, based on generalizations of the coherent information and the quantum data processing inequality. In the context of quantum error-correction codes these concepts were developed in ͓24͔, and were critical in developing the theory of quantum channel capacity ͓24–30͔. Definition of operator quantum error correction. Suppose V is the Hilbert space for some quantum system, and we decompose V = ͑A B͒ C for some choice of A, B, and C. Suppose E is a quantum operation acting on V. Then we say A is an E-correcting subsystem with respect to the decompo-sition V = ͑A B͒ C if there exists a trace-preserving quan-tum operation R ͑the recovery operation͒ such that for all ␳ with support on A, and all ␴ with support on B, we have ͑R ‫ؠ‬ E͒͑␳ ␴͒ ϰ ␳ ␴Ј, for some ␴Ј with support on B. This procedure is named operator quantum error correction. Physically, this means that we can store information in the subsystem A, and recover the information after noise E by applying the recovery operation R. Quantum error-correcting codes arise as the special case of this definition where B is trivial ͑i.e., one dimensional͒, which is equivalent to decomposing V = A C. That is, in an error-correcting code we encode information in a subspace, while in an op-erator error-correcting code we may encode information in a subsystem of a subspace. Algebraic characterization of operator quantum error correction. Remember that a quantum operation E can be expressed in an operator-sum representation E͑␳͒ = ͚ j E j ␳E j , where the ͑nonunique͒ E j 's are called operation elements. Suppose that the noise E has operation elements E j . We will prove that the following two conditions are equivalent.},

@article{Jarzynski2004,
abstract = {The fluctuation theorem (FT) refers to a collection of theoretical predictions [1-7], recently confirmed experimentally [8], pertaining to a system evolving under nonequilibrium conditions. These results are roughly summarized by the equation ln p p{\"{y}}  ; (1) where p denotes the probability that an amount of entropy is generated during a specified time interval. Both transient and steady state versions of the FT have been obtained. The definition of ''entropy generated'' () depends on the dynamics used to model the evolution of the system under consideration. However, for a variety of physical situations, and a variety of equations of motion (both deterministic and stochastic) used to model them, the FT has been established under reasonable definitions of entropy generation. Moreover, the FT is related [9] to a set of free energy relations (see, e.g., [10,11]), which connect equilibrium free energy differences to nonequi-librium work values and which have recently been confirmed experimentally [12]. The situations modeled in Refs. [1-11] all involve an externally driven system, in the presence of a heat reservoir. The purpose of this Letter is to point out that a similar result can be derived in a different setting. Namely, we obtain a symmetry relation constraining the statistics of heat exchange between two bodies initially prepared at different temperatures. We present both classical and quantum derivations and use the term exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) to refer to these results. In what follows, the XFT [Eq. (2)] will be stated and derived. A corollary result related to the second law of thermodynamics will then be presented [Eq. (17)]. Consider two finite bodies, A and B, separately prepared in equilibrium states at temperatures T A and T B , respectively, then placed in thermal contact with one another for a time and then separated again. Let Q denote the net heat transfer from A to B during the interval of contact, i.e., the amount of energy lost by A and gained by B. Now imagine repeating this experiment many times, always initializing the two bodies at the specified temperatures, and let p Q denote the observed distribution of values of Q over the ensemble of repetitions. Then we claim that this distribution satisfies ln p Q p {\"{y}}Q  Q; (2) where  T {\"{y}}1 B {\"{y}} T {\"{y}}1 A is the difference between the inverse temperatures at which the bodies are prepared. In the quantum case we must define Q through an experimental procedure: starting with the two systems initially prepared at different temperatures, we first measure the energy of each system; then we allow them to weakly interact over a time ; and finally, we again measure the energy of each system. We then interpret heat transfer in terms of the changes in these measured energies [Eq. (14)]. This approach is similar in spirit to that taken in Refs. [13-15], which considered related problems. For an alternative approach, see, e.g., [16]. Equation (2) clearly resembles the usual FT, Eq. (1). Indeed, if we invoke macroscopic thermodynamics to argue that {\"{y}}Q=T A is the entropy change of A and Q=T B is that of B, then the net entropy generated by the exchange of heat is given by  Q, and Eq. (2) becomes Eq. (1). However, this argument works only if the heat transferred is very small in comparison with the internal energy of either body, whereas the validity of Eq. (2) does not require this assumption. Therefore, we will leave Eq. (2) as a statistical statement about heat exchange, rather than trying to force it to be a statement about entropy generation per se. To derive Eq. (2) from classical equations of motion, let z A denote the phase space coordinates specifying the microstate of body A (e.g., the positions and momenta of all its degrees of freedom); and let H A z A  be a Hamiltonian whose value defines the internal energy of A, as a function of its microstate. Define z B and H B z B },

abstract = {The presence of a horizon is the principal marker for black holes as they appear in the classical theory of gravity. In General Relativity (GR), horizons have several defining properties. First, there exists a static spherically symmetric solution to vacuum Einstein equations which possesses a horizon defined as a null-surface on which the time-like Killing vector becomes null. Second, in GR, a co-dimension two sphere of minimal area is necessarily a horizon. On a quantum level, the classical gravitational action is supplemented by the quantum effective action obtained by integrating out the quantum fields propagating on a classical background. In this note we consider the case when the quantum fields are conformal and perform a certain non-perturbative analysis of the semiclassical equations obtained by varying the complete gravitational action. We show that, for these equations, both of the above aspects do not hold. More precisely, we prove that i) a static spherically symmetric metric that would describe a horizon with a finite Hawking temperature is, generically, {\{}$\backslash$it not{\}} a solution; ii) a minimal {\$}2{\$}-sphere is {\{}$\backslash$it not{\}} a horizon but a tiny throat of a wormhole. We find certain bounds on the norm of the Killing vector at the throat and show that it is, while non-zero, an exponentially small function of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy of the classical black hole. We also find that the possible temperature of the semiclassical geometry is exponentially small for large black holes. These findings suggest that a black hole in the classical theory can be viewed as a certain (singular) limit of the semiclassical wormhole geometry. We discuss the possible implications of our results.},

abstract = {Quantum computation is a novel way of information processing that allows, for certain classes of problems, exponential speedups over classical computation. Various models of quantum computation exist, such as the adiabatic, circuit, and measurement-based models. They have been proven equivalent in their computational power, but operate very differently. As such, they may be suitable for realization in different physical systems, and also offer different perspectives on open questions such as the precise origin of the quantum speedup. Here, we give an introduction to the one-way quantum computer, a scheme of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). In this model, the computation is driven by local measurements on a carefully chosen, highly entangled state. We discuss various aspects of this computational scheme, such as the role of entanglement and quantum correlations. We also give examples for ground states of simple Hamiltonians that enable universal quantum computation by local measurements.},

Uncertainty relations in terms of entropies were initially proposed to deal with conceptual shortcomings in the original formulation of the uncertainty principle and, hence, play an important role in quantum foundations. More recently, entropic uncertainty relations have emerged as the central ingredient in the security analysis of almost all quantum cryptographic protocols, such as quantum key distribution and two-party quantum cryptography. This review surveys entropic uncertainty relations that capture Heisenberg's idea that the results of incompatible measurements are impossible to predict, covering both finite-and infinite-dimensional measurements. These ideas are then extended to incorporate quantum correlations between the observed object and its environment, allowing for a variety of recent, more general formulations of the uncertainty principle. Finally, various applications are discussed, ranging from entanglement witnessing to wave-particle duality to quantum cryptography.},

abstract = {We used the atomic force microscope to manipulate and unfold individual molecules of the titin I27 domain and reconstructed its free energy surface using Jarzynski's equality. The free energy surface for both stretching and unfolding was reconstructed using an exact formula that relates the nonequilibrium work fluctuations to the molecular free energy. In addition, the unfolding free energy barrier, i.e., the activation energy, was directly obtained from experimental data for the first time. This Letter demonstrates that Jarzynski's equality can be used to analyze nonequilibrium single-molecule experiments, and to obtain the free energy surfaces for molecular systems, including interactions for which only nonequilib-rium work can be measured. One way to probe molecular properties is to drive a system out of equilibrium and to observe the response. Interpretation of data from dynamic measurements allows one to reconstruct both the equilibrium properties of molecules and responses to external perturbations [1]. Equilibrium parameters are usually deduced from kinetic measurements , and it remains challenging to relate nonequi-librium distribution data to equilibrium properties [2]. Advances in single-molecule manipulation and measurement techniques have made it possible to directly probe the dynamics of molecular interactions [3,4]. The nonequilib-rium work theorem, i.e., Jarzynski's equality [5], relates nonequilibrium measurements of nanoscale systems to equilibrium properties [6-8]. It promises to extract ther-modynamic parameters such as free energies from single-molecule measurements. Forced unfolding of single molecules, now achievable using the atomic force microscope (AFM) and laser optical tweezers, has been used to probe the molecular interactions and mechanical properties of individual molecules [3,9]. In these experiments, single molecules are held at both ends and stretched while the cantilever spring restoring force (F s) is measured. Applying an external force drives the system out of equilibrium, and transitions between states are directly observed as the system settles to a new equilibrium state. However, interpretation of these results and deduction of equilibrium properties from these nonequi-librium measurements remains controversial [10-13]. It has been widely anticipated that equilibrium free energy differences can be derived from nonequilibrium measurements using Jarzynski's equality [5]. The difference in equilibrium free energy G is related to the fluctuations of work performed during a nonequilibrium process W by [5,8] he {\"{y}}W i N Z dW W e {\"{y}}W  e {\"{y}}G ; (1) where  1=k B T, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature of the thermal bath. The h.. .i N represents an average over N realizations of the process, and the equality is exact in the limit N ! 1. The nonequilibrium work distribution W  depends on the schedule for varying the work parameter , which is the external perturbation. The equality is simple; however, its application to interpreting single-molecule results is not straightforward. The equation involves the thermodynamic work done on the system and the controlled work parameter with W  R Fd. In AFM experiments, the system includes the cantilever spring and the molecule plus water, and refers to the change in cantilever anchor to stage distance (see Fig. 1), not the tip-to-sample distance, which measures the molecule end-to-end distance z, i.e., the order parameter, or reaction coordinate. We briefly review the experimental setup to which Eq. (1) applies. Consider at time t  0, the system is at an equilibrium state 0  A. We perform external work on the system by controlling the work parameter following a predetermined schedule, t, from an initial state A to a final state B. The system is then allowed to relax to equilibrium while is held constant at B. Since we do not perform external work on the system during relaxation, we can omit this last step and the equality still holds. Hence Jarzynski's equality allows us to determine the G from an equilibrated state A to an arbitrary state B. A proof-of-principle experiment and molecular dynamics simulations testing the Jarzynski estimator have been performed [14,15]. The experimental test involved stretching individual RNA molecules reversibly and irreversibly using optical tweezers, and the free energy of unfolding, i.e., the stability of the molecules, was determined. However , the usefulness of Jarzynski's equality lies with its ability to obtain directly the entire free energy landscape, which could only be estimated using kinetic approaches to date [16]. We will show that Jarzynski's equality can be PRL 99,},

abstract = {In this note we lay some groundwork for the resource theory of thermodynamics in general proba-bilistic theories (GPTs). We consider theories satisfying a purely convex abstraction of the spectral decomposition of density matrices: that every state has a decomposition, with unique probabilities, into perfectly distinguishable pure states. The spectral entropy, and analogues using other Schur-concave functions, can be defined as the entropy of these probabilities. We describe additional conditions under which the outcome probabilities of a fine-grained measurement are majorized by those for a spectral measurement, and therefore the "spectral entropy" is the measurement entropy (and therefore concave). These conditions are (1) projectivity, which abstracts aspects of the L{\"{u}}ders-von Neumann projection postulate in quantum theory, in particular that every face of the state space is the positive part of the image of a certain kind of projection operator called a filter; and (2) symmetry of transition probabilities. The conjunction of these, as shown earlier by Araki, is equivalent to a strong geometric property of the unnormalized state cone known as perfection: that there is an inner product according to which every face of the cone, including the cone itself, is self-dual. Using some assumptions about the thermodynamic cost of certain processes that are partially motivated by our postulates, especially projectivity, we extend von Neumann's argument that the thermodynamic entropy of a quantum system is its spectral entropy to generalized probabilistic systems satisfying spectrality. Much progress has recently been made (see for example [1, 2]) in understanding the fine-grained ther-modynamics and statistical mechanics of microscopic quantum physical systems, using the fundamental idea of thermodynamics as a particular type of resource theory. A resource theory is a theory that governs which state transitions, whether deterministic or stochastic, are possible in a given theory, using specified means. This depends on the kind of state transformations that are allowed in the theory, and in particular on which subset of them are specified as "thermodynamically allowed".},

abstract = {We present a unified approach to quantum error correction, called operator quantum error correction. Our scheme relies on a generalized notion of a noiseless subsystem that is investigated here. By combining the active error correction with this generalized noiseless subsystems method, we arrive at a unified approach which incorporates the known techniques —i.e., the standard error correction model, the method of decoherence-free subspaces, and the noiseless subsystem method —as special cases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum error correction condition from the standard model is a necessary condition for all known methods of quantum error correction. The possibility of protecting quantum information against undesirable noise has been a major breakthrough for the field of quantum computing, opening the path to potential practical applications. In this Letter, we show that the various techniques used to protect quantum information all fall under the same unified umbrella. First, we review the standard model for quantum error correction [1,2] and the passive error prevention methods of ''decoherence-free subspaces'' [3–5] and ''noiseless subsystems'' [6 –8]. We then demonstrate how the latter scheme admits a natural generalization and study the necessary and sufficient con-ditions leading to such generalized noiseless subsystems. This generalized method in turn motivates a unified ap-proach —called operator quantum error correction —that incorporates all aforementioned techniques as special cases. We describe this approach and discuss testable con-ditions that characterize when error correction is possible given a noise model. Moreover, we show that the standard error correction condition is a prerequisite for any of the known forms of error correction or prevention to be feasible. The standard model.—What could be called the ''stan-dard model'' for quantum error correction [1,2] consists of a triple R; E; C where C is a subspace, a quantum code, of a Hilbert space H associated with a given quantum system.

abstract = {A derivation of the quantum-mechanical analog of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation of transport for gases at low density is presented. The analysis requires: the definition of a time differential which is necessary for the selection of only secular variations in the time dependence of the distribution functions (coarse-graining in time); a binary collision approximation; the connection between the phase-space transformation function, relating the Wigner distribution function at different times, and the transition matrix in the theory of scattering of two particles; and. a coarse graining in configuration space leading to a kinetic equation for spatially nonuniform systems. A consequence of the binary collision approximation is the exclusion of the effects of symmetrization (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics) resulting in density-dependent terms. 'HE theory of transport processes in gases at low densities but at temperatures requiring a quantum-mechanical description has been studied in a number of investigations, ' ' with the purpose, in par-ticular, of deriving a transport equation of which the classical analog is the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation. Uehling and Uhlenbeck' have suggested, on the basis of physical arguments, modifications of the classical equation; namely the existence of di6raction e6ects appears to require merely the replacement of the classical cross section by its quantum-mechanical counterpart, and the indistinguishability of the mole-cules of the gas appears to require the consideration of the influence of Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics on the cross section and on the distribution functions. ' It is of interest to ascertain the validity of their pro-posed equation by a derivation of the kinetic equation of transport in dilute gases from the principles of statistical mechanics. In particular, an analysis of this kind may be expected to clarify the statistical-mechani-cal picture of transport in gases, a typical example of irreversible processes. The main conclusions of this work are: firstly, a quantum-mechanical analog of the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation for spatially nonuniform systems may be established which exhibits the quantum-mechanical cross section as expected by Uehling and Uhlenbeck; secondly, strict adherence to the formula-tion of the binary collision mechanism, necessary in (1933). We consider spinless particles for which the symmetry require-ments of the quantum-Inechanical description are restricted to the con6guration space coordinates only. the analysis, excludes the eGect of Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics other than on the cross section. In Sec. I we define distribution functions, discuss their variation in time in terms of transformation functions, and establish, for a two-particle syst: em, the relation between the transformation function and the scattering cross section via the Lippmann-Schwinger theory of scattering. In Sec. II we use these results to derive the transport equation in which we define a particular operation of coarse graining in time and investigate the implications of the binary collision mechanism.

abstract = {We propose a new approach to probing ergodicity and its breakdown in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems based on their response to a local perturbation. We study the distribution of matrix elements of a local operator between the system's eigenstates, finding a qualitatively different behavior in the many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic phases. To characterize how strongly a local perturbation modifies the eigenstates, we introduce the parameter GðLÞ ¼ hlnðV nm =$\delta$Þi, which represents the disorder-averaged ratio of a typical matrix element of a local operator V to energy level spacing $\delta$; this parameter is reminiscent of the Thouless conductance in the single-particle localization. We show that the parameter GðLÞ decreases with system size L in the MBL phase and grows in the ergodic phase. We surmise that the delocalization transition occurs when GðLÞ is independent of system size, GðLÞ ¼ G c ∼ 1. We illustrate our approach by studying the many-body localization transition and resolving the many-body mobility edge in a disordered one-dimensional XXZ spin-1=2 chain using exact diagonalization and time-evolving block-decimation methods. Our criterion for the MBL transition gives insights into microscopic details of transition. Its direct physical consequences, in particular, logarithmically slow transport at the transition and extensive entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, are consistent with recent renormalization-group predictions.},

abstract = {A closed quantum-mechanical system with a large number of degrees of freedom does not neces-sarily give time averages in agreement with the microcanonical distribution. For systems where the different degrees of freedom are uncoupled, situations are discussed that show a violation of the usu-al statistical-mechanical rules. By adding a finite but very small perturbation in the form of a ran-dorn matrix, it is shown that the results of quantum statistical mechanics are recovered. Expecta-tion values in energy eigenstates for this perturbed system are also discussed, and deviations from the n1icrocanonical result are shown to become exponentially small in the number of degrees of free-dom. A question that normally occurs to anyone learning the basics of statistical mechanics is the following: Why does the Gibbs formula work? The crudest explanation ap-pearing in many undergraduate textbooks relies on cou-pling the system to some much larger heat bath. This simply pushes back the problem one stage further, to un-derstand the heat-bath-"plus" system. The more con-vincing explanation considers a classical system in isola-tion. From the assumption of ergodicity, the micro-canonical distribution can be derived, and for a large number of degrees of freedom this can then be shown to give the Gibbs formula. ' The notion of ergodicity is easily seen to lead to statist-ical mechanics classically. Attempts at extending the no-tion of ergodicity to the quantum domain have not suc-ceeded in leading to a similar conclusion. Attempts at a quantum-mechanical justification of statistical mechanics have taken several paths. Criteria for quantum ergodici-ty have either been too general to separate systems obey-ing statistical mechanics from those that do not, or they have been too complex to allow one to find a system satis-fying the criteria. Much work has emphasized the need to couple to an external environment ' such as a heat bath in order to obtain statistical mechanics. In this pa-per a new approach is presented to understand if, and why, the laws of quantum statistical mechanics work for a closed quantum-mechanical system. When a system has a well-defined total energy e, quan-tum statistical mechanics assumes that the average over time (), of some observable quantity (4 A 4) is equal to an ensemble average of all states around energy e: where j labels an energy eigenstate of the entire system and A(e, j) is a normalized function of j that is sharply peaked at (jIHI j) =e. For a system containing a large number of degrees of freedom and for a large class of operators 3, this can be written with negligible error in terms of the usual canonical distribution at fixed temper-ature. The above formulas can be easily extended to take into account large Auctuations in the total energy, as will be done below. For the purposes of this paper, systems obeying the above equation will be called ergodic. There are many examples of systems in classical mechanics with a few degrees of freedom that have time averages given by the microcanonical distribution. A quantized version of such a system cannot be expected to give the microcanonical distribution. It is easy to show by counterexample that one needs at least one more requirement — the number of degrees of the system must also be large. Having a large number of degrees of free-dom, however, is not enough to ensure ergodicity. The distinction between an "ergodic" and an "integrable" quantum system is illustrated by the following gedanken experiments. First, consider a perfect harmonic crystal. If the sys-tem is in an energy eigenstate that has been picked at ran-dom with equal probability from within some energy 43 2046 1991 The American Physical Society 43 BRIEF REPORTS 2047 N Ho= g ho(x P.) (2) range, the expectation of many observables, such as the mean-square displacement of one atom, are in agreement with the results obtained from the Gibbs formula. One can still find many states that do not agree; however, the vast majority of them do. If we now shine a laser on this system, to bring it to a new energy, then, although the quantum-mechanical un-certainty in its energy is very small, time averages will not, in general, agree with Gibbs. This is because the external perturbation will couple most strongly to some phonon modes, giving rise to a distribution significantly different from the Bose distribution. In contrast, if the crystal were "ergodic, " then after it was acted on by the external perturbation it should give the microcanonical distribution, but now at a higher energy. One would like to find an example of a closed quantum-mechanical system that does "give back" the microcanonical distribution after it has been perturbed as described above. The approach taken here is similar to understanding the statistical mechanics of an "ideal gas. " A genuine ideal gas has no interaction between different particles and therefore will not be ergodic. It can be made so, for example, by giving the particles hard cores of very small diameter. This will have a negligible effect on the statistical and thermodynamic properties as com-puted from the Gibbs distribution. However, after a long enough time, the system will explore all of its available phase space, enabling the rigorous application of these formulas. In the same spirit, it will be shown here that if one starts with a nonergodic system with a Hamiltonian that decouples into IV separate subsystems, we have an arbitrary initial state (I, is a complex ampli-tude) (3) one could ask if it is possible to experimentally prepare a system having a very broad distribution for I; — that is, large quantum-mechanical Auctuations in the total ener-gy of the system. The answer appears to be that it is indeed possible. One needs simply to superpose two wave functions of the system, one at a low energy and another at high ener-gy, which can be done by a "Schrodinger's cat" ap-paratus. For a macroscopic system, one would expect that the time average of an observable could be described by the weighted average of two microcanonical averages. The weights are the probability that the system was to be found in one or the other macroscopic state, and the mi-crocanonical averages are taken at the appropriate ener-gies. The assumption being made is that there is negligi-ble interference between two macroscopically diff'erent states. If we denote {\&} A), as the microcanonical average},

abstract = {Under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), quantum-quenched systems equilibrate towards canonical, thermal ensembles. While at first glance the ETH might seem a very strong hypothesis, we show that it is indeed not only sufficient but also necessary for thermalization. More specifically, we consider systems coupled to baths with well-defined macroscopic temperature and show that whenever all product states thermalize then the ETH must hold. Our result definitively settles the question of determining whether a quantum system has a thermal behavior, reducing it to checking whether its Hamiltonian satisfies the ETH. An ideal heat bath induces thermalization in the sense that, when a physical system is coupled to it, its state will evolve into a well-defined infinite-time limit which depends only on macroscopic parameters of the bath—such as its temperature or energy—and not on any details of the initial state of the system, the bath, or the system-bath interaction. It is a well-established empirical fact that both classical and quantum systems with a very large number of degrees of freedom exhibit these ideal-bath properties when weakly coupled to much smaller systems, with their temperature being a smooth function of their energy alone. Yet, rigorous derivations relaying such a " generic " behavior to fundamental dynamical laws seem to require rather sophisticated, and arguably very specific and technical, hypotheses. Then, understanding the mechanisms lying behind the thermalization of a quantum system has become a hot-debated topic in physics. The apparent incongruence between the ubiquity of thermalization and the specificity of the hypotheses that seem to imply it has spurred substantial research [1–30], analyzing the dynamical con-ditions under which a large quantum system behaves as an ideal heat bath and induces thermalization. Prominent among them is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which may be formulated by stating that the partial traces of the eigenstates of the global Hamiltonian of the bath and the coupled system (including the interaction terms) are smooth functions of the energy. It is well known that the ETH is sufficient for thermal-ization if the initial state has a sufficiently sharp distribution in energy [1,19], and a lot of effort has been dedicated in checking whether specific quantum systems satisfy the ETH, with both analytical and numerical computations [9,12,26–30]. The converse question, however, of whether the ETH is also necessary for thermalization, i.e., whether there exist quantum systems not fulfilling the ETH but nonetheless exhibiting thermal behavior, is not settled yet, and alter-natives to the ETH have been proposed [13]. An answer to this question has been hinted at, although not proven, in the literature on the subject (see, e.g., the very recent survey [19], to which the reader is also referred for a comprehensive overview of the context). The goal of the present work is to clarify this subtle and somewhat elusive point by providing, for the first time to our knowledge, a proof that the very definition of an ideal bath actually implies the ETH. Our result then definitively settles the question of determining whether a quantum system has a thermal behavior, reducing it to checking whether its Hamiltonian satisfies the ETH: if the ETH is satisfied, the system always thermalizes, while if it is not satisfied, there certainly exists some reasonable physical initial state not leading to thermalization. Before starting with the actual proof, we find it man-datory to state preliminary, rigorous definitions of thermal-ization, of an ideal bath, and of the ETH itself. We will then reconsider the role of the ETH as a sufficient condition for thermalization on the basis of our definitions, and then proceed to present of our main finding, that the ETH is also necessary for thermalization. Complete proofs of the lemmata needed in the Letter may be found in the Supplemental Material [31]. Thermalization and ideal baths.—Consider a system S coupled to a heat bath B, with Hilbert spaces H S and H B of dimension d S and d B , respectively. For convenience, we describe the total Hamiltonian a H H C H B , com-posed of a free ter H B associated with the bath's inner dynamics, and a ter H C that includes both the free component associated with S and the system-bath coupling component.

For a noncritical final state, the dynamical entanglement entropy is found to approach a finite limiting value for both types of quenches. If the quench is performed to the critical state, the entropy grows for an infinite block as S(t) ∼ ln ln t. This type of ultraslow increase is explained through the strong disorder renormalization group method.},

We present an experimental study of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in a classical two-state system, namely, a metallic single-electron box. We have measured with high statistical accuracy the distribution of dissipated energy as single electrons are transferred between the box electrodes. The obtained distributions obey Jarzynski and Crooks fluctuation relations.

abstract = {This thesis deals with the dynamics of irreversible processes within the context of the general theory of relativity. In particular, we address the problem of the 'infinite' speed of propagation of thermal disturbances in a dissipative fluid. The present work builds on the multi-fluid variational approach to relativistic dissipation, pioneered by Carter, and provides a dynamical theory of heat conduction. The novel property of such approach is the thermodynamic interpretation associated with a two-fluid system whose constituents are matter and entropy. The dynamics of this model leads to a relativistic generalisation of the Cattaneo equation; the constitutive relation for causal heat transport. A comparison with the Israel and Stewart model is presented and its equivalence is shown. This discussion provides new insights into the not-well understood definition of a non-equilibrium temperature. The variational approach to heat conduction presented in this thesis constitutes a mathematically promising formalism to explore the relativistic evolution towards equilibrium of dissipative fluids in a dynamical manner and to get a deeper conceptual understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamic quantities. Moreover, it might also be useful to explore the more fundamental issues of the irreversible dynamics of relativity and its connections with the time asymmetry of nature.},

We show that this surprising phenomenon results from the dephasing due to exponentially small interaction-induced corrections to the eigenenergies of different states. For weak interactions, we find that the entanglement entropy grows as lnðVt=@Þ, where V is the interaction strength, and is the single-particle localization length. The saturated value of the entanglement entropy at long times is determined by the participation ratios of the initial state over the eigenstates of the subsystem. Our work shows that the logarithmic entanglement growth is a universal phenomenon characteristic of the many-body localized phase in any number of spatial dimensions, and reveals a broad hierarchy of dephasing time scales present in such a phase.},

@article{Barato2015a,
abstract = {Biomolecular systems like molecular motors or pumps, transcription and translation machinery, and other enzymatic reactions, can be described as Markov processes on a suitable network. We show quite generally that, in a steady state, the dispersion of observables, like the number of consumed or produced molecules or the number of steps of a motor, is constrained by the thermodynamic cost of generating it. An uncertainty ϵ requires at least a cost of 2k B T=ϵ 2 independent of the time required to generate the output..40.-a, 05.70.Ln Biomolecular processes are generally out of equilibrium and dissipative, with the associated free energy consumption coming most commonly from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. The role of energy dissipation in a variety of processes related to biological information processing has received much attention recently [1-14], to give just one class of examples for which one tries to uncover fundamental limits involving energy dissipation in biomolecular systems. Chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes are of central importance for many cellular processes. Prominent examples are molecular motors [15-19], which convert chemical free energy from ATP into mechanical work. In this case, an observable of interest is the number of steps the motor made. Another commonly analyzed output in enzymatic kinetics is the number of product molecules generated by an enzymatic reaction, for which the Michaelis-Menten scheme provides a paradigmatic case [2]. Quite generally, chemical reactions are well described by stochastic processes. An observable, like the rate of consumed substrate molecules or the number of steps of a motor on a track, is a random variable subjected to thermal fluctuations. Single molecule experiments [20-24] provide detailed quantitative data on such random quantities. Obtaining information about the underlying chemical reaction scheme through the measurement of fluctuations constitutes a field called statistical kinetics [25-28]. A central result in this field is the fact that the Fano factor quantifying fluctuations provides a lower bound on the number of states involved in an enzymatic cycle [15,28]. For a nonzero mean output, the chemical potential difference (or affinity) driving an enzymatic reaction must also be nonzero, leading to a free energy cost. Is there a fundamental relation between the relative uncertainty associated with the observable quantifying the output and the free energy cost of sustaining the biomolecular process generating it? In this Letter, we show that such a general bound does, indeed, exist. Specifically, for any process running for a time t, we show that the product of the average dissipated heat and the square of the relative uncertainty of a generic observable is independent of t and bounded by 2k B T. This uncertainty relation is valid for general networks and can be proved within linear response theory. Beyond linear response theory, we show it analytically for unicyclic networks and verify it numerically for several multicyclic networks. As an illustration of a specific consequence of our results, we obtain a new bound on the Fano factor for unicyclic networks which depends on the affinity driving the process. The observables we consider here arise from counting the number of transitions between states, which is different from a random variable counting the fraction of time spent in a state. For this latter quantity, the relative uncertainty is finite even in equilibrium, as is the case of a cell estimating the concentration of an external environment by counting the fraction of time receptors are bound [29,30]. The role of dissipation for this problem has been recently studied in [5,13]. Our main result can be introduced using, arguably, the simplest example of a nonequilibrium chemical reaction catalyzed by an enzyme, which is a biased random walk where a single step is interpreted as the completion of an enzymatic cycle. Steps to the right happen with a rate k þ , those to the left with a rate k −. After a time t, on average, hXi ¼ ðk þ − k − Þt steps have occurred, with the number of steps X corresponding to the observable of interest. Specific realizations of this random process show a variance hðX − hXiÞ 2 i ¼ ðk þ þ k − Þt [31]. The squared relative uncertainty of the observable is ϵ 2 ≡ ðhX 2 i − hXi 2 Þ=hXi 2 ¼ ðk þ þ k − Þ=½ðk þ − k − Þ 2 t: ð1Þ Assuming an external environment of fixed temperature T, the transition rates are given by the local detailed balance relation k þ =k − ¼ expðA=k B TÞ; ð2Þ},

abstract = {Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this work, we propose an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum currents. Our detection scheme relies on initiating the system in an anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of metastability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the characteristics of the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a 4-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown to be robust under a weak disorder.},

abstract = {We investigate the entanglement properties of the excited states of the spin-1 2 Heisenberg (XXX) chain with isotropic antiferromagnetic interactions, by exploiting the Bethe ansatz solution of the model. We consider eigenstates obtained from both real and complex solutions ('strings') of the Bethe equations. Physically, the former are states of interacting magnons, whereas the latter contain bound states of groups of particles. We first focus on the situation with few particles in the chain. Using exact results and semiclassical arguments, we derive an upper bound S MAX for the entanglement entropy. This exhibits an intermediate behaviour between logarithmic and extensive, and it is saturated for highly-entangled states. As a function of the eigenstate energy, the entanglement entropy is organized in bands. Their number depends on the number of blocks of contiguous Bethe–Takahashi quantum numbers. In the presence of bound states a significant reduction in the entanglement entropy occurs, reflecting that a group of bound particles behaves effectively as a single particle. Interestingly, the associated entanglement spectrum shows edge-related levels. At a finite particle density, the semiclassical bound S MAX becomes inaccurate. For highly-entangled states S A ∝ L c , with L c the chord length, signalling the crossover to extensive entanglement. Finally, we consider eigenstates containing a single pair of bound particles. No significant entanglement reduction occurs, in contrast with the few-particle case.

abstract = {We show that the fraction of time that a thermodynamic current spends above its average value follows the arcsine law, a prominent result obtained by L{\'{e}}vy for Brownian motion. Stochastic currents with long streaks above or below their average are much more likely than those that spend similar fractions of time above and below their average. Our result is confirmed with experimental data from a Brownian Carnot engine. We also conjecture that two other random times associated with currents obey the arcsine law: the time a current reaches its maximum value and the last time a current crosses its average value. These results apply to, inter alia, molecular motors, quantum dots, and colloidal systems. In 1940, Paul L{\'{e}}vy calculated the distribution of the fraction of time T that a trajectory of Brownian motion stays above zero [1]. L{\'{e}}vy proved that this fraction of time is distributed according to PðT Þ ¼ 1 $\pi$ 1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi T ð1 − T Þ p : ð1Þ This result and related extensions are often referred to as the "arcsine law" [2-5]. The name stems from the fact that the cumulative distribution of T reads FðT Þ ¼ R T 0 PðT 0 ÞdT 0 ¼ ð2=$\pi$Þ arcsinð ffiffiffiffi T p Þ. A counterintuitive aspect of the U-shaped distribution (1) is that its average value hT i ¼ 1=2 corresponds to the minimum of the distribution, i.e., the less probable outcome, whereas values close to the extrema T ¼ 0 and T ¼ 1 are much more likely. Brownian trajectories with a long "winning" (positive) or "losing" (negative) streak are quite likely. Several phenomena in physics and biology have been shown to be described by the arcsine law and related distributions. Examples include conductance in disordered materials [6,7], chaotic dynamical systems [8], partial melting of polymers [9], quantum chaotic scattering [10], and generalized fractional Brownian processes [11]. Notably, the arcsine law (1) has also been explored in finance [12], where investment strategies can lead to a much smaller alternance of periods of gain and loss than one would expect based on naive arguments. Recent theory and experiments extended thermodynam-ics to mesoscopic systems that are driven away from equilibrium [13-19]. Mesoscopic systems operate at energies comparable with the thermal energy k B T, where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. At these energy scales, observables such as work, heat, entropy production, and other thermodynamic currents are not deterministic as in macroscopic thermodynamics, but rather stochastic quantities [20]. While the concept of a fluctuating entropy was already suggested by the forefathers of thermodynamics and statistical physics [21], the universal statistical properties of thermodynamic currents discovered in the last two decades have extended thermodynamics, providing novel insights that also apply to the nanoscale. Prominent examples are fluctuation relations [22-28], which generalize the second law of thermodynamics. More recently, several other universal results have been obtained. They include a relation between precision and dissipation known as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation [29-31], stopping time and extreme-value distributions of entropy production (and related observables) [32-35], and efficiency statistics for mesoscopic machines [36-39]. In this Letter, we find a new universal result about the statistics of thermodynamic currents. We demonstrate that the fraction of time T 1 that a generic thermodynamic current stays above its average value (see Fig. 1) is distributed according to Eq. (1). This result is valid for mesoscopic systems in a nonequilibrium steady state and also for periodically driven mesoscopic systems. The proof of the arcsine law for T 1 is based on a theorem for Markov processes that has hitherto remained unexplored in physics [40]. Our results are verified with experimental data from a Brownian Carnot engine [39]. Based on numerical evidence , we also conjecture that two other random variables related to thermodynamic currents are distributed according to (1): the last time a fluctuating current crosses its average T 2 and the time elapsed until a current reaches its maximal PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 121, 090601 (2018) 0031-9007=18=121(9)=090601(5) 090601-1},

Applications of these methods to quantum systems, especially to atomic nuclei, are reviewed. We focus on recent developments like the study of ''imperfect spectra'' to estimate the degree of sym-metry breaking or the fraction of missing levels, the existence of chaos remnants in nuclear masses, the onset of chaos in nuclei, and advances in the comprehension of the Hamilto-nian structure in many-body systems.

I start from a brief introduction to causality restrictions on the distributed measurements: the limitations that are imposed by final propagation velocity of the physical interactions. It is followed by the relativistic transformations of the states of massive particles and photons, from which we can deduce what happens to qubits which are realized as the discrete degrees of freedom. Building on this, I discuss the distinguishability of quantum signals, and briefly touch communication channels and the bipartite entanglement. Creation of the entanglement in scattering processes will be touched only briefly, while the fascinating experimental results on the entanglement in particle physics are discussed in the contribution by Beatrix Hiesmayr.},

Adopting the thermodynamic limit, we derive an ordinary differential equation that exactly describes the temporal evolution of the macroscopic variables in the Ott-Antonsen invariant manifold. The low-dimensional model is then thoroughly investigated for a variety of pulse types and sinusoidal phase response curves (PRCs). Two structurally different synchronization scenarios are found, which are linked via the mutation of a Bogdanov-Takens point. From our results, we infer a general rule of thumb relating pulse shape and PRC offset with each scenario. Finally, we compare the exact synchronization threshold with the prediction of the averaging approximation given by the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. At the leading order, the discrepancy appears to behave as an odd function of the PRC offset.},

Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase space dynamics in the classical limit; classically, chaotic motion coincides with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high entropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work illustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental questions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Imagine air molecules in a room. They move around with all possible velocities in all directions. Attaining the exact knowledge of these trajectories is a daunting and an unrealistic task. Statistical mechanics, however, claims that exact knowledge of individual trajectories is not required and systems can be accurately described using only a few parameters. What is the essential property of these systems that allows for such a simple description? Ergodic dynamics provide an explanation for this simplicity. If the dynamics are ergodic, then the system will uniformly explore all microscopic states over time, constrained only by conservation laws. Ergodicity ensures that O time = =O states (1) where O is any macroscopic observable and brackets denote averaging. In the limit of many particles, macroscopic observables such as pressure or density approach equilibrium and are stationary—therefore, at any time, O(t) = =O time . These two equations imply that macroscopic observables can be predicted by uniformly averaging over all states, and this forms the foundation for all thermodynamic calculations. In classical systems, it is chaotic motion which drives the system to ergodically explore the state space 5 . Quantum systems, however, are governed by Schrodinger's equation, which is linear and consequently forbids chaotic motion 6 . This poses fundamental questions regarding the applicability of statistical mechanics in isolated quantum systems 1–4 . Do quantum systems exhibit ergodic behaviour in the sense of equation (1)? Do quantum systems act as their own bath to approach thermal equilibrium? Extensive experimental efforts have been made to address these fundamental questions 7–13 . Here, we investigate ergodic dynamics by considering a simple quantum model whose classical limit is chaotic 14–18 . This model describes a collection of spin-1/2 particles whose collective motion is equivalent to that of a single larger spin with total angular momentum j governed by the Hamiltonian},

The first part of the book discusses the reformulation of the basis of classical and quantum Hamiltonian physics required by general relativity. The second part covers the basic technical research directions. Appendices include a detailed history of the subject of quantum gravity, hard-to-find mathematical material, and a discussion of some philosophical issues raised by the subject. This fascinating text is ideal for graduate students entering the field, as well as researchers already working in quantum gravity. It will also appeal to philosophers and other scholars interested in the nature of space and time.},

The configuration space of quiver representations (modulo equivalence) in the category of finite spectral triples is studied; gauge networks appear as an orthonormal basis in a corresponding Hilbert space. We give many examples of gauge networks, also beyond the well-known spin network examples. We find a Hamiltonian operator on this Hilbert space, inducing a time evolution on the C * -algebra of gauge network correspondences. Given a representation in the category of spectral triples of a quiver embedded in a spin manifold, we define a discretized Dirac operator on the quiver. We compute the spectral action of this Dirac operator on a four-dimensional lattice, and find that it reduces to the Wilson action for lattice gauge theories and a Higgs field lattice system. As such, in the continuum limit it reduces to the Yang–Mills–Higgs system. For the three-dimensional case, we relate the spectral action functional to the Kogut–Susskind Hamiltonian.},

abstract = {We study the entanglement spectrum in the many body localizing and thermalizing phases of one and two dimensional Hamiltonian systems, and periodically driven `Floquet' systems. We focus on the level statistics of the entanglement spectrum as obtained through numerical diagonalization, finding structure beyond that revealed by more limited measures such as entanglement entropy. In the thermalizing phase the entanglement spectrum obeys level statistics governed by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. For Hamiltonian systems this can be viewed as evidence in favor of a strong version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Similar results are also obtained for Floquet systems, where they constitute a result `beyond ETH', and show that the corrections to ETH governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum have statistical properties governed by a random matrix ensemble. The particular random matrix ensemble governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum depends on the symmetries of the Floquet drive, and therefore can depend on the choice of origin of time. In the many body localized phase the entanglement spectrum is also found to show level repulsion, following a semi-Poisson distribution (in contrast to the energy spectrum, which follows a Poisson distribution). This semi-Poisson distribution is found to come mainly from states at high entanglement energies. The observed level repulsion only occurs for interacting localized phases. We also demonstrate that equivalent results can be obtained by calculating with a single typical eigenstate, or by averaging over a microcanonical energy window - a surprising result in the localized phase. This discovery of new structure in the pattern of entanglement of localized and thermalizing phases may open up new lines of attack on many body localization, thermalization, and the localization transition.},

Our measure is based on comparing a quantum walk with its associated nearest classical random walk, and transcends the existing measures in finding quantum properties. We also introduce a technique to attribute a classical random walk to a quantum walk by a contraction noise channel. We then define total quantumness for a walk as the minimum quantum relative entropy of a walker with respect to its genuinely classical cousin. This stronger nonclassicality measure is shown to include quantum coherence as well, and thus can have numerous applications. We discuss several examples to represent how this measure behaves under various quantum or classical noise scenarios. In particular, we employ our quantumness measures to investigate energy transfer or quantum transport on graphs, which has recently gained much attention and applications, e.g., in photosynthesis. We show that a nonvanishing quantumness measure unambiguously implies that a quantum-walk-based process can reach a higher energy/transport efficiency compared to its classical counterparts, and that decay noises do not necessarily kill all quantum effects in such processes---whence providing a partial explanation for why such processes may outperform relevant classical effects.},

Practically, we exploit the connection between prediction and retrodiction to directly calculate the excess entropy. Conceptually, these lead one to discover new system measures for stochastic dynamical systems: crypticity (information accessibility) and causal irreversibility. Ultimately, we in-troduce a time-symmetric representation that unifies all of these quantities, compressing the two directional representations into one.

Here we review a definition of entanglement entropy that applies to abelian and nonabelian lattice gauge theories. This entanglement entropy is obtained by embedding the physical Hilbert space into a product of Hilbert spaces associated to regions with boundary. The latter Hilbert spaces include degrees of freedom on the entangling surface that transform like surface charges under the gauge symmetry. These degrees of freedom are shown to contribute to the entanglement entropy, and the form of this contribution is determined by the gauge symmetry. We test our definition using the example of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, and find that it agrees with the thermal entropy in de Sitter space, and with the results of the Euclidean replica trick. We discuss the possible implications of this result for more complicated gauge theories, including quantum gravity.},

abstract = {We consider disordered many-body systems with periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians in one spatial dimension. By studying the properties of the Floquet eigenstates, we identify two distinct phases: (i) a many-body localized (MBL) phase, in which almost all eigenstates have area-law entanglement entropy, and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is violated, and (ii) a delocalized phase, in which eigenstates have volume-law entanglement and obey the ETH. The MBL phase exhibits logarithmic in time growth of entanglement entropy when the system is initially prepared in a product state, which distinguishes it from the delocalized phase. We propose an effective model of the MBL phase in terms of an extensive number of emergent local integrals of motion, which naturally explains the spectral and dynamical properties of this phase. Numerical data, obtained by exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation methods, suggest a direct transition between the two phases. Introduction.—The dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems driven out of equilibrium has been the subject of intense investigation over the past decade [1,2]. Many-body systems broadly fall into two classes with distinct dynamical properties: ergodic systems, which reach local thermal equilibrium as a result of the Hamiltonian evolution, and nonergodic ones which fail to thermalize. Thermalization in isolated ergodic systems can be linked to the properties of individual many-body eigenstates that are locally thermal [3–5]. While a complete classification of nonergodic systems remains an open problem, it has recently been established that many-body localization [6–17] provides a robust mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems with quenched disorder. Many-body localized (MBL) systems are characterized by an extensive number of quasilocal integrals of motion [13,14], which strongly restrict quan-tum dynamics and prevent energy transport and thermal-ization. MBL systems have universal dynamical properties, such as the logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement entropy for initial product states [9,11–15], in contrast to ergodic and Bethe-ansatz-integrable systems where entan-glement spreads linearly in time [18–20]. In this Letter, we study the response of MBL systems to periodic driving, which provides a natural experimental probe of both solid-state and cold atoms systems. The ac conductivity of single-particle insulators is conventionally described by the linear-response Mott formula, which predicts a finite absorption at any driving frequency [21]. This suggests that weak periodic driving heats up the system and thermalizes it. On the other hand, a MBL system can be viewed as a collection of localized degrees of freedom with exponentially decaying interactions [13,14]; therefore, one might expect that these degrees of freedom perform nearly independent periodic motion, and a system stabilizes in a highly nonthermal steady state. In what follows, we show that the latter possibility is realized, and MBL persists at weak driving. In contrast, strong driving does delocalize the system, leading to heating and thermalization. The properties of periodically driven systems with a Hamiltonian Hðt þ TÞ ¼ HðtÞ are determined by the uni-tary Floquet operato F, i.e., the evolution operator over one period},

Unlike the standard case, in which the amount of extractable energy is constrained, here there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them.

abstract = {Enough species have now been subject to systematic quantitative analysis of the relationship between the morphology and cellular composition of their brain that patterns begin to emerge and shed light on the evolutionary path that led to mammalian brain diversity. Based on an analysis of the shared and clade-specific characteristics of 41 modern mammalian species in 6 clades, and in light of the phylogenetic relationships among them, here we propose that ancestral mammal brains were composed and scaled in their cellular composition like modern afrotherian and glire brains: with an addition of neurons that is accompanied by a decrease in neuronal density and very little modification in glial cell density, implying a significant increase in average neuronal cell size in larger brains, and the allocation of approximately 2 neurons in the cerebral cortex and 8 neurons in the cerebellum for every neuron allocated to the rest of brain. We also propose that in some clades the scaling of different brain structures has diverged away from the common ancestral layout through clade-specific (or clade-defining) changes in how average neuronal cell mass relates to numbers of neurons in each structure, and how numbers of neurons are differentially allocated to each structure relative to the number of neurons in the rest of brain. Thus, the evolutionary expansion of mammalian brains has involved both concerted and mosaic patterns of scaling across structures. This is, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic model that explains the generation of brains large and small in mammalian evolution, and it opens up new horizons for seeking the cellular pathways and genes involved in brain evolution.},

abstract = {The electronic transport theory of semiconductors is not, from a first-principles point of view, as well un-derstood as is that of metals, where the degeneracy of the Fermi system leads to a simplified but comprehensive theory. In the case of semiconductors, degeneracy usually plays no simplifying role at all. However, in many transport problems of current interest one is effectively dealing with the equivalent of a single particle interacting with an environment, e.g. , a heat bath or a random potential. In view of this, the author presents a simple formalism for the quantum dynamics of a single continuous degree of free-dom. The quantum-statistical description is in terms of the density matrix, and the Feynman rules for a standard treatment of the density matrix are presented and illustrated by applications to problems of current interest. It is shown that such an effect as, for example, the intracollisional field effect, which in the past has been dealt with using complicated formalisms, in the present treatment is described in an ele-mentary way. The single-particle approach conveniently displays the interference aspect of quantum-mechanical transport, as is discussed in a treatment of the weak localization effect in disordered conduc-tors. The real-space representation of quantum transport is stressed, as is appropriate for a proper discus-sion of mesoscopic physics. The author treats the connection between the linear-response formalism and the Landauer approach by expressing the conductance in terms of the scattering properties of a sample. He also discusses the conductance fluctuations of mesoscopic samples.},

We examine expectation values of few-body operators in highly excited many-body eigenstates and search for " outliers, " the eigenstates that deviate the most from ETH. We use exact diagonalization of two one-dimensional nonintegrable models: a quantum Ising chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, and hard-core bosons at half-filling with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor hopping and interaction. We show that even the most extreme outliers appear to obey ETH as the system size increases and thus provide numerical evidences that support ETH in this strong sense. Finally, periodically driving the Ising Hamiltonian, we show that the eigenstates of the corresponding Floquet operator obey ETH even more closely. We attribute this better thermalization to removing the constraint of conservation of the total energy. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052105 PACS number(s): 05.30.−d, 05.70.Ln, 75.10.Pq, 03.65.−w},

We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept concerns the so-called quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined, specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model, and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges, manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in the quantum quench scenario.},

This involves mentally replacing the answer which we seek, with an ensemble of possibilities, then adopting the attitude that each member of the ensemble is an equally likely candidate for the true solution. The choice of ensemble then becomes centrally important, and here information theory provides a reliable guiding principle. The principle instructs us to choose the least biased ensemble ͑the one which minimizes information content͒, subject to some relevant constraints. A well-known illustration arises in classical statistical mechanics: the least biased distribution in phase space, subject to a fixed normalization and average energy, is the canonical ensemble of Gibbs ͓1͔. ͑The prin-ciple of least bias, or maximum entropy, arises in nonequi-librium situations as well ͓2͔.͒ Another example appears in random matrix theory: by minimizing the information con-tent of an ensemble of matrices, subject to various simple constraints, one obtains the standard random matrix en-sembles ͓3͔. The purpose of this paper is to point out that Berry's conjecture ͓4͔ regarding the energy eigenstates of chaotic systems, also emerges naturally from this principle of least bias. Berry's conjecture makes two assertions regarding the high-lying energy eigenstates ␺ E of quantal systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic and ergodic: ͑1͒ Such eigenstates appear to be random Gaussian functions ␺(x) on configuration space, ͑2͒ with two-point correlations given by ␺* ͩ xϪ},

On this basis we give an expression for the probability of fluctuations in the shear stress of a fluid in a nonequilibrium steady state far from equilibrium.

In particular , the two-dimensional modified Lorentz model has been studied [3-5], using the natural invariant measure for cycle expansions in terms of unstable periodic orbits in a dynamical system [3,4]. Although a rather complete theory has been developed for this system where one particle moves through a periodic triangular array of hard disks, the methods used so far are limited to this very special model. Motivated by these one-dimensional results, we propose in the present paper a generalization of the dynamical measure, as yet not well founded, but potentially very useful for the study of many-particle systems in or far from equilibrium. In particular, we study a nonequilibrium stationary state of a Auid under an external shear and conjecture a natural invariant measure for trajectory segments of this many-particle system [6]. This allows us to derive an expression for the ratio of the probabilities to find the Auid on a phase space trajectory segment of duration z in a dynamical state with an induced shear stress in the direction of or opposite to, respectively , the externally imposed shear rate. The second case constitutes, for a finite time z, a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The normalized natural invariant measure of a multidi-mensional system we propose as [6,7] dex n in (1). Equation (1) and all r-dependent equations in the following, are to be interpreted as specializations for finite z of the corresponding equations for the entire trajectory, obtained for z Using (1), stationary state averages can be computed. (2) is a time average of the phase function 2 over the segment i, then the average of A over all segments i all of duration z is (3) =exp =exp[lVd(a;), r].

If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the " half-way " point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel. Our estimate of a black hole's information retention time, based on speculative dynamical assumptions, is just barely compatible with the black hole complementarity hypothesis.},

@article{Davidson2015,
abstract = {We present a formalism for simulating quantum dynamics of lattice spin-1 systems by first introducing local hidden variables and then doing semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation in the extended phase space. In this way, we exactly take into account the local on-site Hamiltonian and approximately treat spin-spin interactions. In particular, we represent each spin with eight classical SUð3Þ variables. Three of them represent the usual spin components and five others are hidden variables representing local spin-spin correlations. We compare our formalism with exact quantum dynamics of fully connected spin systems and find very good agreement. As an application, we discuss quench dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model near the superfluid-insulator transition for a 3D lattice system consisting of 1000 sites. Recent experiments in such areas as ultracold gases, coupled atom-photon systems, ultrafast pump-probe spec-troscopy in solids, and others have stimulated active theoretical research in quantum dynamics of interacting systems. While there has been significant progress in various directions, our understanding is still quite limited. Partly this is due to a lack of reliable and controllable numerical methods. Perhaps the most powerful methods in equilibrium based on quantum Monte Carlo methods are not readily adapted to nonequilibrium systems. The other available methods include simulations based on exact diagonalization, dynamical renormalization-group and related matrix-product-state methods [1], dynamical mean-field-theory-based methods [2,3] mostly developed for fermions and only recently applied to bosons [4], quantum kinetic equations and the Keldysh diagrammatic technique [5], and phase-space methods. The latter has recently become a major tool for studying dynamics of various systems, from interacting atomic clocks to the early Universe [6–12]. These methods are based on mapping the density matrix and operators into classical functions, which depend on phase-space variables like coordinates and momenta, complex wave amplitudes, or classical spin degrees of freedom. Phase-space methods are very efficient for systems near the classical or noninteracting limit, where the quantum evolution is well described by classical trajectories. The main idea of the present work is that we can significantly improve the accuracy of these methods by extending classical phase space by introducing new (hidden) phase-space variables. In this way, we can take into account local quantum fluctuations exactly and treat other degrees of freedom approximately. We illustrate this idea by focusing on an example of spin-1 coupled systems where, in addition to three variables representing the x; y; z components of the spin, we introduce five additional hidden variables representing local spin-spin correlations. We believe these ideas can be further extended and applied to study a large class of interacting systems both in and out of equilibrium. Before proceeding with our ideas, we briefly review the phase-space representation of quantum dynamics of inter-acting bosonic systems. For concreteness, we focus on the Wigner-Weyl quantization (see the Supplemental Material for a brief overview [13]). Any operator of a quantum system that we would normally represent through a function of boson operator a an a can be mapped to a function over the classical phase space of (complex) canonical variables $\alpha$ and $\alpha$ {\~{A}} . This function is called the Weyl symbol of the operator and it is uniquely defined. The Weyl symbol of the density matrix is known as the Wigner function [10,16]. It plays the role of the (quasi-) probability distribution. In general, time evolution of the Wigner function is given by a Fokker-Planck equation with high derivatives, which is hard to handle. However, near the classical limit or for noninteracting systems, one can use the so-called truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) [6,7,10], where the Wigner function, like a classical probability distribution, is conserved on classical trajectories. Then the expectation value of any operator can be straightforwardly computed at any moment in time,},

Such a decomposition can be identified with a vector— the Bloch vector, i.e. a generalization of the well-known qubit case—and is a convenient expression for comparison with measurable quantities and for explicit calculations avoiding the handling of large matrices. We present a new method to decompose density matrices via so-called standard matrices, consider the important case of an isotropic two-qudit state and decompose it according to each basis. In the case of qutrits we show a representation of an entanglement witness in terms of expectation values of spin-1 measurements, which is appropriate for an experimental realization.

This article reviews the recent advances in magnetic and optical manipulation of the NV center's quantum spin and their importance for prospective applications. We discuss how quantum control of individual centers can be harnessed for the protection of NV-center spin coherence, for multiqubit quantum operations in the presence of decoherence, and for high-fidelity initialization and readout. We also discuss the prog-ress in resonant optical control, which has led to interfaces between spin and photonic qubits and may lead to spin networks based on diamond photonics. Many of these recently developed diamond-based technologies constitute critical components for the future leap toward practical multiqubit devices.},

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from ther-mal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macro-scopic thermodynamics as equalities. This review describes some of this progress, and argues that it has refined our understanding of irreversibility and the second law.},

abstract = {N anometre-scale colloidal crystals of group II–VI, III–V and IV–VI semiconductors are prized for their size-dependent optical and electronic properties that emerge as the exci-ton, electron and hole are quantum-confined in the 2–20 nm regime 1,2 . Hence, these crystals are known as quantum dots (QDs) or nanocrystals. As colloids, QDs may be dispersed in solvents and assembled using low-cost, large-area, solution-based tech-niques to form solid-state materials. Akin to the construction of atomic solids from atoms, the creation of QD solids from semi-conductor QD building blocks is dictated by the composition, size and shape of the QDs and their spacing and organization in the solid. In atomic solids, as the interatomic separation between atoms decreases, the electronic wavefunctions of the isolated atomic states increasingly overlap, thus forming extended states in amorphous semiconductors and delocalized bands in crystalline semiconduc-tors. Analogously, in QD solids, as the interdot spacing decreases, the interaction between the electronic wavefunctions of the QDs increases, producing cooperative physical phenomena that are unique to the QD solid. These QD solids may be locally ordered glasses or long-range-ordered QD superlattices or supercrystals. The first evidence of electronic communication between QDs in solids was the observation of fluorescence resonance energy trans-fer, the radiationless transfer of excitations that is possible through electromagnetic interactions between the transition dipoles of neighbouring QDs at larger 1–2 nm interdot spacings 3 . Early studies also demonstrated photo-4 , electrochemical-5 and electrostatically induced 6 charge transport. However, recent methods to decrease the interdot separation further via ligand stripping, exchange or decomposition, and also to dope and passivate the QD surface, are driving the evolution from low-mobility ({\textless}1 cm 2 V –1 s –1) hop-ping transport through localized electronic states to high-mobility ({\textgreater}10 cm 2 V –1 s –1) band-like transport in extended electronic states of QD solids 7–14 . The strength of coupling between QDs in solids can be continuously controlled, thereby allowing us to harness new combinations of optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical prop-erties in QD solids that are not found in natural materials systems. The combination of high-mobility charge transport and solution-based deposition of QD solids is spurring the design of these mate-rials for electronic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Here we review the synthesis, assembly, ligand treatments and doping of QDs and their solids that have been explored Charge transport in strongly coupled quantum dot solids},

The latter is explicitly time dependent and, even though it does not commute with the physical Hamiltonian, it behaves as a conserved quantity of the time-evolving system. We discuss two examples of integrable systems in which the emergent eigenstate solution can be applied for an extensive (in system size) time: transport in one-dimensional lattices with initial particle (or spin) imbalance and sudden expansion of quantum gases in optical lattices. We focus on noninteracting spinless fermions, hard-core bosons, and the Heisenberg model. We show that current-carrying states can be ground states of emergent local Hamiltonians, and that they can exhibit a quasimomentum distribution function that is peaked at nonzero (and tunable) quasimomentum. We also show that time-evolving states can be highly excited eigenstates of emergent local Hamiltonians, with an entanglement entropy that does not exhibit volume-law scaling.},

abstract = {Intertwiners are the building blocks of spin-network states. The space of intertwiners is the quantization of a classical symplectic manifold introduced by Kapovich and Millson. Here we show that a theorem by Minkowski allows us to interpret generic configurations in this space as bounded convex polyhedra in R 3 : A polyhedron is uniquely described by the areas and normals to its faces. We provide a reconstruction of the geometry of the polyhedron: We give formulas for the edge lengths, the volume, and the adjacency of its faces. At the quantum level, this correspondence allows us to identify an intertwiner with the state of a quantum polyhedron, thus generalizing the notion of the quantum tetrahedron familiar in the loop quantum gravity literature. Moreover, coherent intertwiners result to be peaked on the classical geometry of polyhedra. We discuss the relevance of this result for loop quantum gravity. In particular, coherent spin-network states with nodes of arbitrary valence represent a collection of semiclassical polyhedra. Furthermore, we introduce an operator that measures the volume of a quantum polyhedron and examine its relation with the standard volume operator of loop quantum gravity. We also comment on the semiclassical limit of spin foams with nonsimplicial graphs.},

abstract = {Traditional answers to what the 2nd Law is are well known. Some are based on the microstate of a system wandering rapidly through all accessible phase space, while others are based on the idea of a system occupying an initial multitude of states due to the inevitable imperfections of measurements that then effectively, in a coarse grained manner, grow in time (mixing). What has emerged are two somewhat less traditional approaches from which it is said that the 2nd Law emerges, namely, that of the theory of quantum open systems and that of the theory of typicality. These are the two principal approaches, which form the basis of what today has come to be called quantum thermodynamics. However, their dynamics remains strictly linear and unitary, and, as a number of recent publications have emphasized, “testing the unitary propagation of pure states alone cannot rule out a nonlinear propagation of mixtures”. Thus, a non-traditional approach to capturing such a propagation would be one which complements the postulates of QM by the 2nd Law of thermodynamics, resulting in a possibly meaningful, nonlinear dynamics. An unorthodox approach, which does just that, is intrinsic quantum thermodynamics and its mathematical framework, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics. The latter has evolved into an effective tool for modeling the dynamics of reactive and non-reactive systems at atomistic scales. It is the usefulness of this framework in the context of quantum thermodynamics as well as the theory of typicality which are discussed here in some detail. A brief discussion of some other trends such as those related to work, work extraction, and fluctuation theorems is also presented.},

abstract = {We study the transition to chaos and the emergence of statistical relaxation in isolated dynamical quantum systems of interacting particles. Our approach is based on the concept of delocalization of the eigenstates in the energy shell, controlled by the Gaussian form of the strength function. We show that, although the fluctuations of the energy levels in integrable and nonintegrable systems are different, the global properties of the eigenstates are quite similar, provided the interaction between particles exceeds some critical value. In this case, the statistical relaxation of the systems is comparable, irrespective of whether or not they are integrable. The numerical data for the quench dynamics manifest excellent agreement with analytical predictions of the theory developed for systems of two-body interactions with a completely random character.

One of the important issues is the onset of thermalization in isolated dynamical quantum systems due to interparticle interactions. A prerequisite for thermalization is the statistical relaxa-tion of the system to some kind of equilibrium and its viability has been associated with the onset of quantum chaos. The latter term was originally created to address specific properties of dynamical quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic. Later, it was found that similar properties of spectra, eigenstates, and dynamics could emerge in quantum systems without a classical limit, as well as in quantum systems with disordered potentials. Nowadays, the term quantum chaos is used in a broader context when referring to those properties, irrespective of the existence of a classical limit. According to studies of isolated quantum many-body systems, their eigenfunctions (EFs) in the mean-field (mf) basis spread as the interaction between particles (or quasi-particles) increases and they may eventually become cha-otic eigenstates. The latter term refers to eigenstates with a large number of uncorrelated components, thus allowing one to use statistical methods for their description [2]. Examples based on experimental data include excited states of the cerium atom [3] and compound states in heavy nuclei [4]. It should be stressed that in isolated systems with finite-range interaction, only part of the basis states jni defined by the noninteracting (quasi)particles is directly coupled when the perturbation is turned on. Thus, the exact eigenstates ji ¼ P n C n jni overlap only with some of the basis states, that is only a fraction of the components C},

abstract = {Thermalization and scrambling are the subject of much recent study from the perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces (" spin chains "), quantum field theory, and holography. We tackle this problem in 1D spin chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by a " hydrodynamical " equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy). In this hydrodynamic picture, quantum information travels in a front with a " butterfly velocity " v B that is smaller than the light-cone velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time. The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do not observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form ∼e $\lambda$ L ðt−x=vÞ for a fixed Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ L . We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the hydrodynamical description applies to more generic Floquet ergodic systems, and we support this idea by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator wavefront also holds in a more traditional nonrandom Floquet spin chain. We also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.},

This transition was affected by changes in the ionic strength of the medium and the water activity or by cross-linking of the two strands of dsDNA. Individual molecules of single-stranded DNA were also stretched giving a persistence length of 7.5 angstroms and a stretch modulus of 800 pN.

abstract = {We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the entropy rate of the system to be zero under any system-environment Hamiltonian interaction. We call the class of system-environment states that satisfy this condition lazy states. They are a generalization of classically correlated states defined by quantum discord, but based on projective measurements of any rank. The concept of lazy states permits the construction of a protocol for detecting global quantum correlations using only local dynamical information. We show how quantum correlations to the environment provide bounds to the entropy rate, and how to estimate dissipation rates for general non-Markovian open quantum systems. Protecting a quantum system from decoherence is one of the main challenges in quantum computation [1]. It is common to only consider a system state (S) initially un-correlated from its environment (E), but that is weakly coupled to it. A measure that quantifies the degree of decoherence of the system is the von Neumann entropy S : ¼ {\`{A}}trf S ln S g. In such a case, decoherence arises from correlations developed as a consequence of the SE coupling which change the system entropy. Starting from this point of view that assumes that the system undergoes open quantum system dynamics [2-4], the entropy of quantum systems can be preserved from decoherence. Symmetries of the dynamics can be exploited [5-9] or dynamical operations can be performed [10-12] to stabilize the entropy of a system. We depart from that approach that focuses on the structure of the open system dynamics with an unknown environment and the standard approximations that go with it. Instead, we take the point of view of studying the structure of the total system-environment states SE and their relationship to the system decoherence. This allows us to make theoretical progress, without resorting to assuming explicit knowledge of the SE Hamiltonian. In this Letter, we find universal properties of the system entropy rates that are independent of the details of the SE coupling. By taking this different approach, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the class of system-environment states for which the rate of change of the system entropy at a time (entropy rate) is zero, d dt Sð S Þj t¼ , for any type of interaction with the environment H int. We also demonstrate how correlations to the environment not only lead to decoherence, but also provide a bound on the decoherence rate valid beyond the weak-coupling limit and without any assumptions of Markovianity. Our proof goes beyond previous work by Kimura et al. [13,14] which showed that SE correlations were a necessary condition for the change of purity (linear entropy) under any interaction. To prove these results, we consider general evolution of the density operator in finite-dimensional Hilbert space SE given by the von Neumann equation, d dt SE t j t¼ ¼ {\`{A}}i½H tot ; SE . The total Hamiltonian is H tot ¼ H S I E þ I S H E þ H int [15], which consists of the system, the environment and the interaction Hamiltonians [16]. The time dependence of H tot is implicit, but without loss of generality we write H tot in the picture where H int is time-independent. Using this, we want to consider properties of the dynamics of the system density matrix at time , S ¼ P j p j {\AA} S j , where f{\AA} j g are orthonormal projectors of any rank chosen such that fp j g is nondegenerate. We start by considering functions of the form of f N ð S Þ ¼ tr S fð S Þ N g ¼ P j p N j. By taking the trace of the environment in the von Neumann equation, and taking the time derivative of f N , we obtain, ½ d dt f N ð S t Þ t¼ ¼ {\`{A}}itr S fNð S Þ N{\`{A}}1 {\^{A}} tr E ½H tot ; SE g ¼ {\`{A}}iNtr SE fð S Þ N{\`{A}}1 I E ½H int ; SE g, where the cyclic property of the trace was used. Note that the dependence on H S and H E vanishes [17]. Using the cyclic property of the trace once more, we find, ½ d dt f N  ¼ P j Np N{\`{A}}1 j ½ d dt p j  ¼ iNtrfH int ½ð S Þ N{\`{A}}1 I E ; SE g. With this result at hand, which is valid for all powers N, we do a series expansion of the von Neumann entropy to obtain the exact expression for the entropy rate: d dt S t¼ ¼ {\`{A}}itr SE fH int ½lnð S Þ I E ; SE g; (1) which expresses the dependence of the entropy rate in terms of the system-environment interaction H int and the commu-tator [ lnð S Þ I E , SE ]. This expression is true for any kind of system-environment couplings, including strong PRL 106, 050403 (2011) P H Y S I C A L},

We show that the entanglement of the multiqubit system, considered for both the bipartite and the pairwise entanglement, yields a signature of quantum chaos. Whereas bipartite entangle-ment is enhanced in the chaotic region, pairwise entanglement is suppressed. Furthermore, we define a time-averaged entangling power and show that this entangling power changes markedly as ␬ moves the system from being predominantly regular to being predominantly chaotic, thus sharply identifying the edge of chaos. When this entangling power is averaged over all states, it yields a signature of global chaos.

The injected energy is modeled in anti-de Sitter space as an infalling shell, and the information shared by disjoint intervals is computed in terms of geodesic lengths in this background. For given widths and separation of the intervals, the mutual information typically starts at its vacuum value, then increases in time to reach a maximum, and then declines to the value at thermal equilibrium. A simple causality argument qualitatively explains this behavior. The tripartite information is generically nonzero and time-dependent throughout the process. This contrasts with (but does not contradict) the time-independent tripartite information one finds after a two-dimensional quantum quench in the limit of large time and distance scales compared to the initial inverse mass gap.},

abstract = {We consider a problem of interference between two independent condensates that lack true long-range order. We show that their interference pattern contains information about correlation functions within each condensate. As an example, we analyze the interference between a pair of one-dimensional interacting Bose liquids. We find universal scaling of the average fringe contrast with system size and temperature that depends only on the Luttinger parameter. Moreover, the full distribution of the fringe contrast, which is also equivalent to the full counting statistics of the interfering atoms, changes with interaction strength and lends information on high-order correlation functions. We also demonstrate that the interference between two-dimensional condensates at finite temperature can be used as a direct probe of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our results to describe the interference of a periodic array of independent fluctuating condensates.},

It is based on modelling heat engines as driven multipartite systems subject to projective quantum measurements and measurement-conditioned unitary evolutions. The theory unifies various results presented previously in the literature. Feedback control breaks time reversal invariance. This in turn results in the fluctuation relation not being obeyed. Its restoration occurs through appropriate accounting of the gain and use of information via measurements and feedback. We further illustrate an experimental proposal for the realisation of a Maxwell demon using superconducting circuits and single-photon on-chip calorimetry. A two-level qubit acts as a trap-door, which, conditioned on its state, is coupled to either a hot resistor or a cold one. The feedback mechanism alters the temperatures felt by the qubit and can result in an effective inversion of temperature gradient, where heat flows from cold to hot thanks to the gain and use of information.},

abstract = {A simple evolutionary process can discover sophisticated methods for emergent information processing in decentralized spatially extended systems. The mechanisms underlying the resulting emergent computation are explicated by a technique for analyzing particle-based logic embedded in pattern-forming systems. Understanding how globally coor-dinated computation can emerge in evolution is relevant both for the scientific understanding of natural information pro-cessing and for engineering new forms of parallel computing systems. Many systems in nature exhibit sophisticated collective infor-mation-processing abilities that emerge from the individual actions of simple components interacting via restricted com-munication pathways. Some often-cited examples include ef-ficient foraging and intricate nest-building in insect societies (1), the spontaneous aggregation of a reproductive multicel-lular organism from individual amoeba in the life cycle of the Dictyostelium slime mold (2), the parallel and distributed processing of sensory information by assemblies of neurons in the brain (3), and the optimal pricing of goods in an economy arising from agents obeying local rules of commerce (4). Allowing global coordination to emerge from a decentralized collection of simple components has important advantages over explicit central control in both natural and human-constructed information-processing systems. There are sub-stantial costs incurred in having centralized coordination, not the least being (i) speed (a central coordinator can be a bottleneck to fast information processing), (ii) robustness (if the central coordinator is injured or lost, the entire system collapses), and (iii) equitable resource allocation (a central},

abstract = {Quantum systems of many particles, which satisfy the ergodicity hypothesis, are conventionally described by statistical mechanics. However, not all quantum systems are er-godic, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism of ergodicity breaking by disorder. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at non-zero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. In this Colloquium we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and non-equilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasi-local integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the ergodicity breaking mechanism. A description based on quasi-local integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum en-tanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. We outline the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases, and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally , synthetic quantum systems, which are well-isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. We review recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, quantum materials, and superconducting qubits, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed. We conclude by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

@article{Kinoshita2006,
abstract = {It is a fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics that a closed system with many degrees of freedom ergodically samples all equal energy points in phase space. To understand the limits of this assumption, it is important to find and study systems that are not ergodic, and thus do not reach thermal equilibrium. A few complex systems have been proposed that are expected not to thermalize because their dynamics are integrable 1,2 . Some nearly integrable systems of many particles have been studied numeri-cally, and shown not to ergodically sample phase space 3 . However, there has been no experimental demonstration of such a system with many degrees of freedom that does not approach thermal equilibrium. Here we report the preparation of out-of-equili-brium arrays of trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases, each containing from 40 to 250 87 Rb atoms, which do not noticeably equilibrate even after thousands of collisions. Our results are probably explainable by the well-known fact that a homogeneous 1D Bose gas with point-like collisional interactions is integrable. Until now, however, the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium 1D Bose gases has been a theoretically unsettled issue 4–6 , as practical factors such as harmonic trapping and imperfectly point-like interactions may compromise integrability. The absence of damp-ing in 1D Bose gases may lead to potential applications in force sensing and atom interferometry. To see qualitatively why 1D gases might not thermalize, consider the elastic collision of two isolated, identical mass classical particles in one dimension. Energy and momentum are conserved only if they simply exchange momenta. Clearly, the momentum distribution of a 1D ensemble of particles will not be altered by such pairwise collisions. The well-known behaviour of Newton's cradle (see Fig. 1a) is most easily understood in this way. Even when several balls are simultaneously in contact, particles in an idealized Newton's cradle just exchange specific momentum values, though the expla-nation is more subtle 7 . Generalization of the Newton's cradle to quantum mechanical particles lends it a ghostly air. Rather than just reflecting off each other, colliding particles can also transmit through each other. When the particles are identical, the final states after transmission and reflection are indistinguishable. In general, correlations and overlap among 1D Bose gas wavefunc-tions complicate the picture of independent particles colliding as in a Newton's cradle. In fact, there are circumstances in which 1D momentum distributions are known to change in time. For example, when weakly coupled bosons are released from a trap, the conversion of mean field energy to kinetic energy changes the momentum distribution. In the Tonks–Girardeau limit of infinite strength interactions 8 , although the 1D bosons interact locally like non-interacting fermions, their momentum distribution is not fermio-nic 9,10 . When a Tonks–Girardeau gas is released from a trap and expands in one dimension, its momentum distribution evolves into that of a trapped Fermi gas 11–13 . The quantum Newton's cradle view of particles colliding with each other and either reflecting or transmitting can only be applied when the kinetic energy of the collision greatly exceeds the energy per atom at zero temperature at the prevailing density 14 . The collisions that we study satisfy this criterion well. Our observations extend from the Tonks–Girardeau regime, where only pairwise collisions can occur 15 , to the intermediate coupling regime, where there can be three-(or more) body col-lisions 15–17 . In both regimes, atoms that are set oscillating and colliding in a trap do not appreciably thermalize during our experiment. We start our experiments with a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into the combination of a blue-detuned two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice and a red-detuned crossed dipole trap (see Methods). The combination of light traps makes a 2D array of distinct, parallel Bose gases, with the 2D lattice providing tight transverse confinement and the crossed dipole trap providing weak axial trap-ping 11},

abstract = {Entangled quantum objects 1 are correlated in ways that reject the principle of local realism. In few-level quantum systems, entangled states have been investigated extensively as a means of studying the foundations of quantum mechanics 2 and as a resource for quantum information applications 3 . Recently, it was realized that the concept of entanglement has broad impact in many areas of quantum many-body physics, ranging from condensed matter 4 to high-energy field theory 5 and quantum gravity 6 . In this general context, entanglement is most often quantified by the entropy of entanglement 1 that arises in a sub-system when the information about the remaining system is ignored. This entanglement entropy exhibits qualitatively different behaviour from that of classical entropy and has been used in theoretical physics to probe various properties of many-body systems. In condensed matter physics, for example, the scaling behaviour 7 of entanglement entropy allows phases to be distinguished that cannot be characterized by symmetry properties, such as topological states of matter 8–10 and spin liquids 11,12 . Entanglement entropy can be used to probe quan-tum criticality 13 and non-equilibrium dynamics 14,15 , and to determine whether efficient numerical techniques for computing many-body physics exist 16 . Despite the growing importance of entanglement in theoretical physics, current condensed matter experiments do not have a direct probe with which to detect and measure entanglement. Synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms 17,18 , photonic networks 19 , and some microscopic solid state devices 20 have unique advantages: in such systems control and detection of single particles are possible, they pro-vide experimental access to relevant dynamical time scales, and they are isolated from the environment. In these systems, specific entan-gled states of few qubits, such as the highly entangled Greenberger– Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state 21 have been experimentally created and detected using witness operators 22 . However, entanglement witnesses are state specific. For arbitrary states, an exhaustive method of recon-structing the entire quantum state by tomography 23 can be used to measure entanglement. This has been accomplished in small systems of photonic qubits 24 and trapped ion spins 25 , but there is no known way to perform tomography for systems involving itinerant delocal-ized particles. With multiple copies of a system, however, one can use quantum many-body interference to quantify entanglement even in itinerant systems 15,26,27 . In this work, we take advantage of the precise control and readout afforded by our quantum gas microscope 28 to prepare and interfere two identical copies of a four-site Bose–Hubbard system. This many-body quantum interference enables us to measure quantities that are not directly accessible in a single system (without tomography), for exam-ple, quadratic functions of the density matrix 15,26,27,29–32 . Such non-linear functions can reveal entanglement 1 . In our system, we directly measure the quantum purity, R{\'{e}}nyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information to probe the entanglement in site occupation numbers. Bipartite entanglement To detect entanglement in our system, we use a fundamental property of entanglement between two subsystems (bipartite entanglement): ignoring information about one subsystem results in the other becom-ing a classical mixture of pure quantum states. This classical mixture in a density matrix $\rho$ can be quantified by measuring the quantum purity, defined as Tr($\rho$ 2},

abstract = {We establish a link between unitary relaxation dynamics after a quench in closed many-body systems and the entanglement in the energy eigenbasis. We find that even if reduced states equilibrate, they can have memory on the initial conditions even in certain models that are far from integrable. We show that in such situations the equilibrium states are still described by a maximum entropy or generalized Gibbs ensemble, regardless of whether a model is integrable or not, thereby contributing to a recent debate. In addition, we discuss individual aspects of the thermalization process, comment on the role of Anderson localization, and collect and compare different notions of integrability. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.040401 PACS numbers: 05.30.{\`{A}}d, 03.65.Yz, 05.70.Ln The question of how quantum many-body systems in nonequilibrium eventually equilibrate and assume proper-ties resembling the ones familiar from statistical mechan-ics has—quite unsurprisingly—a very long tradition [1]. In closed systems not all observables can equilibrate. However, it is generally expected that in sufficiently complicated quantum many-body systems at least some physically relevant quantities should seemingly relax to equilibrium values. Recently this old question has received an enormous amount of attention and there have been significant new insights [2–18]. This renewed attention is partly driven by new mathe-matical methods becoming available, partly by novel nu-merical techniques, and in part by experiments that make it possible to probe coherent nonequilibrium dynamics under the controlled conditions offered by cold atoms in optical lattices [19]. Theoretically, the question of how quantum many-body systems relax locally has been investigated in the light of the ''eigenstate thermalization hypothesis'' (ETH) [2,3], quantum central limit theorems [4], Anderson localization [7], dynamical instances of concen-tration of measure arguments or ideas of relaxation via dephasing [8–13,16], and numerically using time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group [20]. Despite this enormous effort, major questions remain open and the existing results do not yet draw a coherent picture. What seems to have become consensus, however, is that the following expectation holds true: Nonintegrable systems thermalize. In this Letter we show that generally this is not quite true. We do so by establishing a link between the entangle-ment in the eigenbasis of a quantum many-body system with what could be called the thermalization potential of the system. We will investigate situations in which systems equilibrate, in the sense that all local observables will be close to some equilibrium value at most times, but those values turn out to depend on the details of the initial state. This general rigorous statement is exemplified numerically by studying a small natural nonintegrable XYZ-type spin chain model. In previous approaches (e.g., in Ref. [21]), similar complementing observations have been made by simulating the model's time evolution explicitly. However, such simulations can only trace the system's behavior for a finite amount of time. Our analytic results have applica-tions far beyond this particular model: they yield general conditions for the absence of thermalization. This gives a natural counterpart of the ETH, and it relates the thermal-ization of isolated quantum systems to the presence of entanglement in the energy eigenbasis. Setup and notation.—Whenever using terms and con-cepts borrowed from classical statistical mechanics, such as ergodicity, equilibration, thermalization, initial state independence, and integrability, we aim at being careful and precise. We work in the pure state quantum statistical mechanics model with a system and bath setup with a global pure state and unitary time evolution [4,8–12]. We are mostly interested in the case where the full system is composed of many interacting small systems and the sub-system corresponds to a small subset of sites and the bath is simply the remainder. In such systems the individual sub-systems act as baths for each other and the collective dynamics can lead to self-thermalization of the whole system. To be specific, we will consider arbitrary quantum systems equipped with a Hilbert space H of finite dimen-sion d that can be divided into at least two parts, i.e., H ¼ H S H B , which we will call the subsystem S and the bath B, and which are described by Hilbert spaces of dimensions d S=B ¼ dimðH S=B Þ. We assume that at every time t the joint system is in a pure state c t ¼ jc t ihc t j, evolving unitarily. The reduced states on subsystem and bath are denoted using superscript letters, such as c S ¼ Tr B ½c . We denote the Hamiltonian of the full system by H},

We then consider an electronic structure application, the electronic density of states of amorphous silica, and study the convergence of the Fermi level with increasing number of moments.},

abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the nuclear level density is important both from a theoretical viewpoint as a powerful instrument for studying nuclear structure and for numerous applications. For example, astrophysical reactions responsible for the nucleosynthesis in the universe can be understood only if we know the nuclear level density. We use the configuration-interaction nuclear shell model to predict nuclear level density for all nuclei in the sd-shell, both total and for individual spins (only with positive parity). To avoid the diagonalization in large model spaces we use the moments method based on statistical properties of nuclear many-body systems. In the cases where the diagonalization is possible, the results of the moments method practically coincide with those from the shell-model calculations. Using the computed level densities, we fit the parameters of the Constant Temperature phenomenological model, which can be used by practitioners in their studies of nuclear reactions at excitation energies appropriate for the sd-shell nuclei.},

abstract = {Quantum coherence is a key element in topical research on quantum resource theories and a primary facilitator for design and implementation of quantum technologies. However, the resourcefulness of quantum coherence is severely restricted by environmental noise, which is indicated by the loss of information in a quantum system, measured in terms of its purity. In this work, we derive the limits imposed by the mixedness of a quantum system on the amount of quantum coherence that it can possess. We obtain an analytical trade-off between the two quantities that upperbound the maximum quantum coherence for fixed mixedness in a system. This gives rise to a class of quantum states, "maximally coherent mixed states," whose coherence cannot be increased further under any purity-preserving operation. For the above class of states, quantum coherence and mixedness satisfy a complementarity relation, which is crucial to understand the interplay between a resource and noise in open quantum systems.},

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

On the other hand, perfect tensors are highly entangled many-body quantum states with local density matrices maximally mixed. Recently, the notion of perfect tensors has attracted a lot of attention in the fields of quantum information theory, condensed matter theory, and quantum gravity. In this work, we introduce the concept of an invariant perfect tensor (IPT), which is an n-valent tensor that is both invariant and perfect. We discuss the existence and construction of IPTs. For bivalent tensors, the IPT is the unique singlet state for each local dimension. The trivalent IPT also exists and is uniquely given by Wigner's j 3 symbol. However, we show that, surprisingly, 4-valent IPTs do not exist for any identical local dimension d. On the contrary, when the dimension is large, almost all invariant tensors are asymptotically perfect, which is a consequence of the phenomenon of the concentration of measure for multipartite quantum states.},

If present, each part contributes in a characteristic way to the time dependence of the entanglement entropy: (a) linear production, (b) bounded oscillations, and (c) logarithmic production. In the second part, we use numerical calculations to go beyond Gaussian states and quadratic Hamiltonians. We provide numerical evidence for the conjecture that entanglement production through quadratic Hamiltonians has the same asymptotic behavior for non-Gaussian initial states as for Gaussian ones. Moreover, even for nonquadratic Hamiltonians, we find a similar behavior at intermediate times.

The finite-size scaling reveals that the crossover between the two regimes is given by a scale closely related to the scattering length.

We show that this assumption is too restrictive, since there are systems that are asymptotically in a thermal state, yet exhibit anomalous, subdiffusive thermalization. We show that such systems satisfy a modified version of the ETH ansatz and derive a general connection between the scaling of the variance of the offdiagonal matrix elements of local operators, written in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian, and the dynamical exponent. We find that for subdiffusively thermalizing systems the variance scales more slowly with system size than expected for diffusive systems. We corroborate our findings by numerically studying the distribution of the coefficients of the eigenfunctions and the offdiagonal matrix elements of local operators of the random field Heisenberg chain, which has anomalous transport in its thermal phase. Surprisingly, this system also has non-Gaussian distributions of the eigenfunctions, thus directly violating Berry's conjecture.},

Since the early 2000s various measures of quantum entanglement have been employed to characterise the features of the ground and excited states of quantum matter. Furthermore, the scaling of entanglement entropy with the size of a system has inspired modifications to numerical techniques for the simulation of many-body systems leading to the, now established, area of tensor networks. However, the knowledge and the methods brought by quantum information do not end with bipartite entanglement. There are other forms of quantum correlations that emerge "for free" in the ground and thermal states of condensed matter models and that can be exploited as resources for quantum technologies. The goal of this work is to review the most recent development on quantum correlations for quantum many-body systems focussing on multipartite entanglement, quantum non locality, quantum discord, mutual information but also other non classical resources like quantum coherence.

abstract = {Mutually unbiased bases for quantum degrees of freedom are central to all theoretical investigations and practical exploitations of complementary properties. Much is known about mutually unbiased bases, but there are also a fair number of important questions that have not been answered in full as yet. In particular, one can find maximal sets of N + 1 mutually unbiased bases in Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimension N = pm, with p prime and m a positive integer, and there is a continuum of mutually unbiased bases for a continuous degree of freedom, such as motion along a line. But not a single example of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number (N = 6, 10, 12, . . . ). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the basis states are labeled by numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1 that are both elements of a Galois field and ordinary in- tegers. This dual nature permits a compact systematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they are known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other cases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually un- biased bases in quantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation, entanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which rely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the familiar two–q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased bases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also exploit the one-to- one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex Hadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other. The ultimate hope, not yet fulfilled, is that open ques- tions about mutually unbiased bases can be related to open questions about Hadamard},

abstract = {The project concerned the study of quantum correlations (QC) in compound systems, i.e. statistical correlations more general than entanglement which are predicted by quantum mechanics but not described in any classical scenario. I aimed to understand the technical and operational properties of the measures of QC, their interplay with entanglement quantifiers and the experimental ac- cessibility.
In the first part of my research path, after having acquired the conceptual and technical rudiments of the project, I provided solutions for some computational issues: I developed analytical and numerical algorithms for calculating bipar- tite QC in finite dimensional systems. Then, I tackled the problem of the ex- perimental detection of QC. There is no Hermitian operator associated with entanglement measures, nor with QC ones. However, the information encoded in a density matrix is redundant to quantify them, thus the full knowledge of the state is not required to accomplish the task. I reported the first protocol to measure the QC of an unknown state by means of a limited number of measure- ments, without performing the tomography of the state. My proposal has been implemented experimentally in a NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) setting. In the final stage of the project, I explored the foundational and operational merits of QC. I showed that the QC shared by two subsystems yield a gen- uinely quantum kind of uncertainty on single local observables. The result is a promising evidence of the potential exploitability of separable (unentangled) states for quantum metrology in noisy conditions.},

abstract = {Transport properties are among the defining characteristics of many important phases in condensed-matter physics. In the presence of strong correlations they are difficult to predict, even for model systems such as the Hubbard model. In real materials, additional complications arise owing to impurities, lattice defects or multi-band effects. Ultracold atoms in contrast offer the possibility to study transport and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a clean and well-controlled environment and can therefore act as a quantum simulator for condensed-matter systems. Here we studied the expansion of an initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous optical lattice. For non-interacting atoms, we observe ballistic transport, but even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal, with a dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard model. I n solid-state physics, transport properties are among the key observables, the most prominent example being the electri-cal conductivity, which, for example, allows one to distin-guish normal conductors from insulators or superconductors. Furthermore, many of today's most intriguing solid-state phe-nomena manifest themselves in transport properties, examples including high-temperature superconductivity, giant magnetoresis-tance, quantum-Hall physics, topological insulators and disorder phenomena. Especially in strongly correlated systems, where the interactions between the conductance electrons are important, transport properties are difficult to calculate. In general, predicting out-of-equilibrium fermionic dynamics represents an even harder problem than the prediction of static properties such as the nature of the ground state. In real solids further complications arise owing to the effects, for example, of impurities, lattice defects and phonons. These complications render an experimental investiga-tion in a clean and well-controlled ultracold-atom system highly desirable. Although recent years have seen dramatic progress in the control of quantum gases in optical lattices 1–3 , a thorough understanding of the dynamics in these systems is still lacking. Genuine dynamical experiments can not only uncover new dynamic phenomena but are also essential to gain insight into the timescales needed to achieve equilibrium in the lattice 4,5 or to adiabatically load into the lattice 6,7 . Using both bosonic and fermionic 8–10 atoms, it has become possible to simulate models of strongly interacting quantum particles, for which the Hubbard model 11 is probably the most important example. A major advantage of these systems compared with real solids is the possibility to change all relevant parameters in realtime by, for example, varying laser intensities or magnetic fields.},

abstract = {A relation is obtained between the parameter describing the irreversible response of a driven dissipative system and the spontaneous fluctuations of the thermodynamic extensive parameters of the system in equihbrium. The development given in this paper'extends the theorem, previously proven in the statistical mechanical domain, to the macroscopic thermodynamic domain. 1. DTTRODUCTION 'HIS paper is one of a series of contributions to the development of a theory of "irreversible thermo-dynamics"-that is, to the extension of the methods of thermodynamics to the treatment of real irreversible processes. We shall show that the mean square deviation of the spontaneously Quctuating extensive parameters of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is related. to the dissipative part of the admittance function which characterizes the irreversible response of the system to applied forces. If (P) denotes the mean square fluctuation in the frequency interval determined by the range of integration, we shall show that-2k ({\&}')= {\~{}} {\~{}} .() Ol 2kT (P) = dauo U(a{\&})ro-'. The 6rst of these equations applies to a system in which all extensive parameters other than that which Quc-tuates are held constant, whereas the second equation applies to a system with similar constraints except that the constraint on the energy is replaced by the condition of adiabatic insulation. The quantities o;(re) and oU(ro) are conductances deined appropriately to these respective constraints. These equations may be re-expressed , although somewhat less directly, in terms of equivalent Quctuating forces and then appear as gencraiizations of the Nyquist C1ectrical noise formula. ' The modern theory of irreversible thermodynamics was 6rst projected in 193j. by Onsager' with the formulation of a general relation of reciprocity in the mutual interference of two simultaneous irreversible processes. Applications of this one basic theorem constitute the totality of the existing theory of irreversible therIQodynamics. There are two possible methods of approach to the {\~{}} theory of irreversible thermodynamics, which might be characterized as the statistical approach and the ther-modynamic approach. The statistical approach consists of genera1izing the methods of statistical mechanics, and a theorem proved in this framework must then, of course, be, projected into the macroscopic thermo-dynamic domain by a reasoning similar to that which projects the statistical mechanical H theorem into the macroscopic second law of thermodynamics. The alternative , or thermodynamic, approach consists in generalizing the methods of thermodynamics itself, which is already on a macroscopic level. Whereas the results of the thermodynamic approach are thus in more immediate contact with macroscopic irreversibility than are the results of the statistical approach, the postulates of the latter are closer to fundamental theory. Each approach clearly has its advantages and each may be independent1y prosecuted. The Onsager reciprocity thcoI'cIQ, origina j. ly obtRlncd by a thcrIQodynRIQlc approach, has also been derived by the statistical RPPl oacI1. The touchstone of the thermodynamic approach to lxrcvcl siblllty theory lies lQ thc intimate conncctlon between irreversible processes and the regression of spontRQcous Quctuatlons ln cquilibriuIQ systcIQS. This connection has occasionally been criticized because conventional thermodynamic Quctuation theory is an approximate theory valid only for smaO Quctuations, whereas real irreversible processes may involve appreciable deviations from equilibrium. However, in a previous paper' of this series we have reformulated thermodynamic Quctuation theory on an exact basis which ls valid foI' Quctuatlons of arbitrary size. Thc thermodynamic approach, based on the analysis of the regression of spontaneous Quctuations, will be employed in this paper. In addition to Onsager's reciprocity theorem a new theorem has recently been established. {\~{}} This relates the dissipation parameter (the "resistance") to the spectral density of the equilibrium Quctuations and is the 4H. B. Callen, thesis, Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1948. {\~{}} The extent of the deviation from equilibrium which is compatible with the validity of the Onsager reciprocity theorem is established by the statistical approach (reference 4) and has also been considered by I.

abstract = {The problem of how complex quantum systems eventually come to rest lies at the heart of statistical mechanics. The maximum-entropy principle describes which quantum states can be expected in equilibrium, but not how closed quantum many-body systems dynamically equilibrate. Here, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of a density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime of strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we follow its dynamics in terms of quasi-local densities, currents and coherences—all showing a fast relaxation towards equilibrium values. Numerical calculations based on matrix-product states are in an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that the controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms can keep track of. U ltracold atoms in optical lattices provide highly controllable quantum systems allowing one to experimentally probe various quantum many-body phenomena. In this way, ground state properties of Hamiltonians that play a fundamental role in the condensed matter context have been investigated under precisely tunable conditions 1–3 . Features that are even harder to probe in actual condensed matter materials or to simulate in numerical studies are dynamical ones, including dynamical properties emerging in adiabatic sweeps 4 and in systems far from equilibrium 5–11 . In this respect, for example, the quench from a shallow to a deep optical lattice 6–8 and the phase dynamics emerging after splitting a one-dimensional Bose liquid 12 have previously been studied experimentally. Here, we report on the direct observation of relaxation dynamics in an interacting many-body system using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Starting with a patterned density with alternating empty and occupied sites in isolated Hubbard chains, we suddenly switched on the tunnel coupling along these chains and measured the emerging dynamics in terms of quasi-local densities, currents and coherences. Both the initial state preparation and the detection were realized using a bichromatic optical superlattice 13,14 . For a wide range of (repulsive) inter-particle interactions, we find a fast relaxation of the measured observables to steady-state values, where the timescale of the relaxation cannot be attributed to a classical ensemble average. We find the time evolution of the quasi-local densities and currents to initially follow a power law with an exponent being significantly larger than that expected for free or hardcore bosons. For short times, we compare the experimental results to time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations (t -DMRG, for a review},

abstract = {One of the elementary processes in quantum magnetism is the propagation of spin excitations. Here we study the quantum dynamics of a deterministically created spin-impurity atom, as it propagates in a one-dimensional lattice system. We probe the spatial probability distribution of the impurity at different times using single-site-resolved imaging of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the Mott-insulating regime, the quantum-coherent propagation of a magnetic excitation in the Heisenberg model can be observed using a post-selection technique. Extending the study to the superfluid regime of the bath, we quantitatively determine how the bath affects the motion of the impurity, showing evidence of polaronic behaviour. The experimental data agree with theoretical predictions, allowing us to determine the effect of temperature on the impurity motion. Our results provide a new approach to studying quantum magnetism, mobile impurities in quantum fluids and polarons in lattice systems. D eepening our knowledge of quantum magnetism 1 is one of the main goals in quantum simulation. In particular, one highly desired aim is a better understanding of high-T c cuprate superconductors, which are believed to be described by Heisenberg-type effective spin models in the limit of low doping 2 . More generally, the physics characterized by the Heisenberg model governs the properties of many strongly correlated materials 3 , and allows the realization of various types of spin order ranging from spin solids to spin liquids 1,4 . In low-dimensional quantum magnets, rich physics emerges owing to the dynamics of spin excitations 5 . A basic mechanism of quantum magnetism in strongly correlated electronic systems is superexchange, in which, for example, opposite spins on adjacent lattice sites coherently exchange their positions. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices offer an ideal testbed to explore these phenomena in a controlled experimental environment 6,7 , as shown by the observation of superexchange in double-well systems 8},

abstract = {Bridging the second law of thermodynamics and microscopic reversible dynamics has been a longstanding problem in statistical physics. Here, we address this problem on the basis of quantum many-body physics, and discuss how the entropy production saturates in isolated quantum systems under unitary dynamics. First, we rigorously prove that the entropy production does indeed saturate in the long time regime, even when the total system is in a pure state. Second, we discuss the non-negativity of the entropy production at saturation, implying the second law of thermodynamics. This is based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which states that even a single energy eigenstate is thermal. We also numerically demonstrate that the entropy production saturates at a non-negative value even when the initial state of a heat bath is a single energy eigenstate. Our results reveal fundamental properties of the entropy production in isolated quantum systems at late times.},

abstract = {Laser tweezers and atomic force microscopes are increasingly used to probe the interactions and mechanical properties of individual molecules. Unfortunately, using such time-dependent perturbations to force rare molecular events also drives the system away from equilibrium. Nevertheless, we show how equilibrium free energy profiles can be extracted rigorously from repeated non-equilibrium force measurements on the basis of an extension of Jarzynski's remarkable identity between free energies and the irreversible work. R ecent advances in the micromanipulation of single molecules have led to new insights into the dynamics, interactions, structure , and mechanical properties of individual molecules (1-4). Single-molecule manipulation with an atomic force microscope (AFM) (5-9), laser tweezer stretching (10), and analogous computer experiments pioneered by Schulten and coworkers (11-13) have revealed details about unfolding and unbinding events of individual proteins and their complexes. In an AFM experiment, a molecule is subjected to a time-varying external force, for instance by pulling on the end of a linear polymer (Fig. 1). The applied force is determined from the time-dependent position of the cantilever tip with respect to the sample. Thus, one can drive rare molecular events (14), determine their force characteristics, and simultaneously monitor them with atomic resolution. However, both experiments and simulations actively perturb the system, leading to hysteresis and nonequilibrium effects. How can one extract equilibrium properties from such measurements that drive the system away from equilibrium (15, 16)? From the second law of thermodynamics, we know that on average, the mechanical work of pulling will be larger than the free energy. Only if the experiment is performed reversibly, i.e., infinitely slowly, will the work equal the free energy. Thus, making rigorous thermody-namic measurements by pulling appears to require an extrapolation to zero pulling speed. However, Jarzynski (17, 18) recently discovered a remarkable identity between thermodynamic free energy differences and the irreversible work, thus extending the inequality of the second law of thermodynamics. This identity, although not directly applicable to atomic force measurements, suggests that in principle one should be able to extract free energy surfaces from repeated pulling experiments. In this paper, we show how this can be done in practice. Theory. We begin by showing that Jarzynski's identity follows almost immediately from the Feynman-Kac theorem for path integrals (19). This derivation leads directly to the appropriate extension, which forms the basis for the solution of the free energy reconstruction problem. This extension has been obtained by Crooks (20) as a special case of an even more general relation between forward and backward path averages. Consider a system whose phase-space density evolves according to a Liouville-type equation: fx, t t t fx, t. [1] t is an explicitly time-dependent evolution operator that has the Boltzmann distribution as a stationary solution, t e (x,t) 0, where (x, t) is a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and 1 k B T, with T the temperature and k B Boltzmann's constant. For example, for diffusive dynamics on a potential V(x, t), the time evolution is governed by t De V(x,t) e V(x,t) , where D is the diffusion coefficient and x. Other examples include systems that undergo Newtonian, Langevin, Nos{\'{e}}-Hoover thermostat , or Metropolis Monte Carlo dynamics. Now consider the unnormalized Boltzmann distribution at time t, px, t e x,t e x,0 dx. [2] Because this distribution is stationary (t p 0), and because pt (t)p, it follows that the above p(x, t) is a solution of the sink equation, p t t p H t p, [3] as can be verified by direct substitution. However, the solution of this sink equation, starting from an equilibrium distribution at time t 0, can also be expressed as a path integral by using the Feynman-Kac theorem (19). Equating these two different solutions immediately gives: e x,t e x,0 dx x x t exp 0 t t x t , tdt [4] where (x) is Dirac's distribution. This identity between a weighted average of nonequilibrium trajectories (right) and the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution (left) is implicit in the work of Jarzynski (18), and is given explicitly by Crooks (equation 24, ref. 20). The average. .. is over an ensemble of trajectories starting from the equilibrium distribution at t 0 and evolving according to Eq. 1. Each trajectory is weighted with the Boltz-mann factor of the external work w t done on the system, w t 0 t t x t , tdt. [5] Integrating both sides of Eq. 4 with respect to x, we obtain Jarzynski's identity (17, 18) Abbreviation: AFM, atomic force microscopy.},

abstract = {Entanglement, one of the central mysteries of quantum mechanics, plays an essential role in numerous tasks of quantum information science. A natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection can be accomplished without full state tomography. In this Letter, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for nonadaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine a previously implemented experiment [H. Park et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 230404 (2010)], which claimed to detect entanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without full state tomography. In contrast, our simulation and experiment both support the opposite conclusion that the protocol, indeed, leads to full state tomography, which supplements our no-go theorem. These results reveal a fundamental limit of single-copy measurements in entanglement detection and provide a general framework of the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as the positivity of partial transpose and the k-symmetric extendibility.},

@article{Khripkov2015,
abstract = {We highlight a dynamical anomaly in which the rate of relaxation towards thermal equilibrium in a bi-partite quantum system violates the standard linear-response (Kubo) formulation, even when the underlying dynamics is highly chaotic. This anomaly originates from an ℏ-dependent sparsity of the underlying quantum network of transitions. Using a minimal bi-partite Bose–Hubbard model as an example, we find that the relaxation rate acquires an anomalous ℏ dependence that reflects percola-tion-like dynamics in energy space. The connection between thermalization and chaotic ergodicity is well-established for classical systems [1]. Since strict dynamical chaos is absent in isolated quantum systems, contemporary research efforts [2–19] are aimed to find novel quantum signatures such as Anderson localization [20–22] in the thermalization of quantized chaotic systems. The current paradigm for thermalization of coupled quantum subsystems is linear response theory (LRT). If the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic, thermalization is attained via diffusive spreading which is described by a Fokker–Planck–equation (FPE) [14–19], leading to ergodization of the composite system over all accessible states within a microcanonical energy shell. LRT is related to the Fermi-golden-rule (FGR) picture in which the rates of transitions between the unperturbed eigenstates of the subsystems are given by first-order-perturbation matrix elements, but over long timescales that involve many perturbative orders. The diffusion coefficient D of the FPE is estimated from these rates by a Kubo formula [23, 24]. LRT implies quantum-to-classical correspondence (QCC) in the FPE description, which is somewhat analogous to the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn f-sum-rule, and has been termed 'restricted QCC' [25]. The argument that supports restricted QCC with regard to the FPE picture is based on the observation that for short times the variance (unlike the higher moments) features a robust QCC, while for long times the central limit theorem makes all higher moments irrelevant. Thus LRT based description becomes accurate far beyond the naive expectation. The restricted QCC assumption prevails in all current work on thermalization [5–18]. Deviations from LRT have either a classical or a quantum origin. Classical deviations result from dynamical quasi-integrability in the mixed phase space [26, 27] which can make thermalization a slow and intricate process [2–4]. By contrast quantum anomalies are directly related to the breakdown of QCC due to the finite value of the Planck constant ℏ. One well-known example for such quantum anomaly is the loss of ergodicity due to many-body Anderson localization [20–22]. In this Letter we highlight a new type of quantum anomaly which does not originate from the lack of quantum ergodicity, but from the ℏ-dependent sparsity of the quantum network of transitions. The classical-Kubo-FGR picture relies critically on the existence of a dense, connected network of transitions between all the available states, so that all transitions contribute to the diffusive energy spreading process. However, such dense networks do not always exist. The quantum network of transitions is generally sparse [28], resulting in a percolation-like process of energy spreading, that is dominated by bottlenecks and preferred pathways. As a result, the Kubo formula grossly overestimates the thermalization rate and QCC is lost even when the underlying classical dynamics is highly chaotic.},

abstract = {This paper presents a pedagogical review of duality {\{}in the sense of Kramers and Wannier) and its application to a wide range of field theories and statistical systems. Most of'the article discusses systems in arbitrary dimensions with discrete or continuous Abelian symmetry. Globally and locally symmetric interactions are treated on an equal footing. For convenience, most of the theories are formulated on a d-dimensional {\{}Euclidean) lattice, although duality transforrnations in the continuum are briefly described. Among the familiar theories considered are the Ising model, the x-y model, the vector Potts model, and the Wilson lattice gauge theory with a ZN or U(l) symmetry, all in various dimensions. These theories are all members of a more general heirarchy of theories with interactions which are distinguished by their geometrical character. For all these Abelian theories it is shown that the duality transformation maps the high-temperature (or, for a field theory, large coupling constant) region of the theory into the low-temperature (small coupling constant) region of the dual theory, and vice versa. The interpretation of the dual variables as disorder parameters is discussed. The formulation of the theories in terms of their topological excitations is presented, and the role of these excitations in determining the phase structure of the theories is explained. Among the other topics discussed are duality for the Abelian Higgs model and related models, duality transformations applied to random systems (such as theories of a spin glass), duality transformations in the "lattice Hamiltonian" formalism, and a description of attempts to construct duality transforrnations for theories with a non-Abelian symmetry, both on the lattice and in the continuum.}}},

The temporal fluctuations around this value, response to further perturbations, and the relaxation toward this asymptotic value are all determined by the off-diagonal matrix elements. Motivated by this nonequilibrium role, we present generic statistical properties of off-diagonal matrix elements of local observables in two families of interacting many-body systems with local interactions. Since integrability (or lack thereof) is an important ingredient in the relaxation process, we analyze models that can be continuously tuned to integrability. We show that, for generic nonintegrable systems, the distribution of off-diagonal matrix elements is a Gaussian centered at zero. As one approaches integrability, the peak around zero becomes sharper, so the distribution is approximately a combination of two Gaussians. We characterize the proximity to integrability through the deviation of this distribution from a Gaussian shape. We also determine the scaling dependence on system size of the average magnitude of off-diagonal matrix elements.},

The similar result requiring equality of the infinite series in the case that the sequences x and y are summable is an extension of a recent theorem by Arveson and Kadison.

Further results on majorization for infinite sequences providing "intermediate" sequences generalize known results from the finite case. Majorization properties and invariance under various classes of stochastic matrices are then used to characterize arithmetic mean closed operator ideals.},

abstract = {Quantum fluctuations relations are typically derived with projective measurements of energy at the beginning and the end of the protocol. Though projective measurements are easy to treat theoretically, they may be difficult to implement in experiments. We show that recent results on the force protocol with generalized measurements remain valid with more general forms of quantum evolution. In the case considered, states of an open quantum system are transformed according to an arbitrary trace-preserving completely positive map. The energy measurements used in the protocol are prescribed as a superposition of projec-tive ones. Such measurements can be parameterized by a continuous variable substituted into acceptance functions of the apparatuses. The role of limited measurement precision is also clarified here. As is known, the standard Jarzynski equality and the Tasaki-Crooks theorem remain valid for the case of unital quantum channels. Using characteristic functions, we recast standard relations for the scenario with generalized measurements. With respect to the Jarzynski equality, generalized measurements lead to a negative shift in observed values of the difference of free energies. A deviation of the actual quantum channel from unital ones may also generate some shift with an arbitrary sign.},

@article{Rigol2008,
abstract = {An understanding of the temporal evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been elusive. Recently, meaning-ful experimental studies 1,2 of the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest 3–7 . In generic isolated systems, non-equilibrium dynamics is expected 8,9 to result in thermaliza-tion: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible in a sense ana-logous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical therma-lization possible 10 . For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete 11 . Some recent studies 4,5 even suggest that statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demon-strate that a generic isolated quantum many-body system does relax to a state well described by the standard statistical-mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first pro-posed by Deutsch 12 and Srednicki 13 . A striking consequence of this eigenstate-thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal averages—any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because they all give the same result. If we pierce an inflated balloon inside a vacuum chamber, very soon we find that the released air has uniformly filled the enclosure and that the air molecules have attained the Maxwell velocity distri-bution, the width of which depends only on the total number and energy of the air molecules. Different balloon shapes, placements, or piercing points all lead to the same spatial and velocity distributions. Classical physics explains this 'thermodynamical universality' as fol-lows 10 : almost all particle trajectories quickly begin to look alike, even if their initial points are very different, because nonlinear equations drive them to explore the constant-energy manifold ergodically, cov-ering it uniformly with respect to precisely the microcanonical mea-sure. However, if the system possesses further conserved quantities that are functionally independent of the hamiltonian and each other, then time evolution is confined to a highly restricted hypersurface of the energy manifold. Hence, microcanonical predictions fail and the system does not thermalize. In contrast, in isolated quantum systems not only is dynamical chaos absent owing to the linearity of time evolution and the dis-creteness of spectra 11 , but also it is not clear under what conditions conserved quantities provide independent constraints on the relaxa-tion dynamics. On the one hand, any operator commuting with a generic, and thus non-degenerate, hamiltonian is functionally dependent on it 14 , seemingly implying that conservation of energy is the only independent constraint. On the other hand, even when operators are functionally dependent, their expectation values— considered as functionals of states—generally are not: for example, two states may have the same mean energies but different means of squared energies. For non-degenerate hamiltonians a maximal set of constants of motion with functionally independent expectation values is as large as the dimension of the Hilbert space; examples include the projectors {\^{}} P a {\~{}} Y a j i Y a h j to the energy eigenstates},

This means that the state of the system ␳ S ͑t͒ approaches an equilibrium state ␳ eq S , the latter depending only on macroscopic characteristics of the bath ͑e.g., temperature͒ but not on the initial state of the system. The above statement is the cornerstone of the equilibrium statistical mechanics; its validity and its domain of applicability are central questions in the studies of the foundations of statistical mechanics. In the present paper we concentrate on one aspect of thermalization, namely, on the system initial state independence ͑ISI͒ of ␳ eq S . A necessary condition for the system ISI is derived in the quantum framework. We use the derived condition to prove the absence of the system ISI in a specific class of models. Namely, we consider a single spin coupled to a large bath, the interaction term commuting with the bath self-Hamiltonian ͑but not with the system self-Hamiltonian͒. Although the model under consideration is nontrivial enough to exhibit the decoherence and the approach to equilibrium, the derived necessary condition is not fulfilled and thus ␳ eq S depends on the initial state of the spin.},

abstract = {Majorization uncertainty relations are derived for arbitrary quantum operations acting on a finite-dimensional space. The basic idea is to consider submatrices of block matrices comprised of the corresponding Kraus operators. This is an extension of the previous formulation, which deals with submatrices of a unitary matrix relating orthogonal bases in which measurements are performed. Two classes of majorization relations are considered: one related to tensor product of probability vectors and another one related to their direct sum. We explicitly discuss an example of a pair of one-qubit operations, each of them represented by two Kraus operators. In the particular case of quantum maps describing orthogonal measurements the presented formulation reduces to earlier results derived for measurements in orthogonal bases. The presented approach allows us also to bound the entropy characterizing results of a single generalized measurement.},

We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and derive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of the model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where the chains are prepared: (1) at different temperatures, (2) in the ground state of two different models, and (3) in the " domain wall " state. We find excellent agreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on time-evolving block decimation algorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation values of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.},

@article{Hatano2001,
abstract = {We study Langevin dynamics describing nonequilibirum steady states. Employing the phenomenologi-cal framework of steady-state thermodynamics constructed by Oono and Paniconi [Prog. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 130, 29 (1998)], we find that the extended form of the second law which they proposed holds for transitions between steady states and that the Shannon entropy difference is related to the excess heat produced in an infinitely slow operation. A generalized version of the Jarzynski work relation plays an important role in our theory. The second law of thermodynamics describes the fundamental limitation on possible transitions between equilibrium states. In addition, it leads to the definition of entropy, in terms of which the heat capacity and equations of state can be treated in a unified way. In contrast to equilibrium systems, with their elegant theoretical framework, the understanding of nonequilib-rium steady-state systems is still primitive. The broad goal with which we are concerned in this paper is to establish the connection between the phenomena displayed by nonequilibrium steady states and thermodynamic laws. We expect that a unified framework that describes both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena can be obtained by extending the second law to the state space consisting of equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. There have been several attempts to construct such a framework [1-4]. Among them, a phenomenological framework proposed by Oono and Paniconi seems most sophisticated, and their framework has been named "steady-state thermody-namics" (SST) [4]. Oono and Paniconi focused on transitions between steady states and distinguished steadily generated heat, which is generated even when the system remains in a single state in the state space and the total heat. They call the former the "housekeeping heat." Subtracting the housekeeping heat from the total heat defines the excess heat, which reflects the change of the system in the state space: Q ex Q tot 2 Q hk. (1) Here Q tot and Q hk denote the total heat and the housekeeping heat, respectively. By convention, we take the sign of heat to be positive when it flows from the system to the heat bath. For equilibrium systems, Q ex reduces to the total heat Q tot , because in this case Q hk 0. Because any proper formulation of SST should reduce to equilibrium thermo-dynamics in the appropriate limit, Q ex should correspond to the change of a generalized entropy S within the SST. Here we treat systems in contact with a single heat bath whose temperature is denoted by T , so that the second law of SST reads [4] T DS {\$} 2Q ex. (2) The equality here holds for an infinitely slow operation in which the system is in a steady state at each time during a transition. (We call such a process a "slow process.") That is, the generalized entropy difference DS between two steady states can be measured as 2Q ex T resulting from a slow process connecting these two states. This allows us to define the generalized entropy of nonequilib-rium steady states experimentally, by measuring the excess heat obtained in a slow process between any nonequilib-rium steady state and an equilibrium state, whose entropy is known. These are phenomenological considerations and they should ultimately be confirmed through experiments. As a preliminary step toward this confirmation, in this Letter, we find support for the validity of the above discussion by studying a simple stochastic model. With the same motivation , Sekimoto and Oono considered a simple Langevin system and defined the quantity Q ex [5,6]. However, this nonequilibrium system reduces to an equilibrium system through a suitable transformation of variables and hence lacks generality. Also, one of the present authors has found that the minimum work principle holds for certain types of transitions between steady states [7], with some assumption regarding the steady-state measure. In this Letter, we derive the inequality (2) in a more general context and show that the equality holds for slow processes. This result relates the excess heat to the generalized entropy. We consider the dynamics of a Brownian particle in a circuit driven by an external force. These dynamics are described by the Langevin equation g x 2 ≠Ux; l ≠x 1 f 1 jt , (3) where jt represents Gaussian white noise whose intensity is 2gk B T. We employ periodic boundary conditions, and thus the particle flows due to the nonconservative force f. This simple nonequilibrium system was investigated by Kurchan with regard to the fluctuation theorem [8]. Transitions between steady states are realized by changing the parameters l and f. We assume that if the system is left unperturbed, it eventually reaches a steady state which is uniquely determined by the parameter values. Although 0031-90070186(16)3463(4){\$}15.00},

abstract = {Epitaxial attachment of quantum dots into ordered superlattices enables the synthesis of quasi-two-dimensional materials that theoretically exhibit features such as Dirac cones and topological states, and have major potential for unprecedented optoelectronic devices. Initial studies found that disorder in these structures causes localization of electrons within a few lattice constants, and highlight the critical need for precise structural characterization and systematic assessment of the eeects of disorder on transport. Here we fabricated superlattices with the quantum dots registered to within a single atomic bond length (limited by the polydispersity of the quantum dot building blocks), but missing a fraction (20{\%}) of the epitaxial connections. Calculations of the electronic structure including the measured disorder account for the electron localization inferred from transport measurements. The calculations also show that improvement of the epitaxial connections will lead to completely delocalized electrons and may enable the observation of the remarkable properties predicted for these materials. T he unique electronic properties of nanostructured materials inspire future applications and present intriguing scientific challenges. Recent advances in the controlled formation of superlattices by epitaxial connection of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), also known as quantum dots, have the potential for creating materials with properties by design. The ability to control the atomic structure of the quantum dot building block (that is, size, shape and composition) and the geometry of the superstructure creates opportunities to synthesize and study designer materials. Calculations of such quantum dot solids with a dimensionality less than 2 forecast a rich electronic structure that differs profoundly from the corresponding quantum well 1 . Although the predicted emergence of electronic phenomena including topological states and Dirac cones intrigue scientists 1–4 , experimental support is still lacking. Prerequisite to an experimental realization of predicted electronic band structure is a transition from localized to delocalized electrons, which requires highly ordered superlattices and strong coupling between NCs (ref. 5). Recent experimental efforts to improve the electronic properties of quantum dot solids have focused on increasing inter-dot coupling by replacing organic ligands with inorganic ligands 6,7 or by ligand removal 8 . However, this approach leads to band formation only when the coupling energy overcomes energetic and translational disorder 5,9 . Oriented attachment is a simple route to simultaneously increase inter-dot coupling and enforce translational order, as demonstrated in several recent reports 10–13 . Initial studies find that charges in these structures are localized to within a few lattice constants owing to disorder 14,15 . It has been shown recently that charge transport in such structures occurs through incoherent hopping between epitaxial segments 16 . These findings highlight the critical need for precise analysis of the structure of the quantum dot solid and a quantitative assessment of the effects of disorder on transport. We address this challenge by combining advanced structure characterization techniques (aberration-corrected electron microscopy and X-ray scattering) to precisely determine structure and disorder parameters as inputs for tight-binding electronic structure calculations. We discovered that translational order in these structures is controlled down to about a single atomic bond length, a limit imposed by the 4{\%} size dispersion of the NC building blocks. To probe the intrinsic charge transport in these structures we performed variable temperature field-effect measurements in epitaxially connected quantum dot superlattice devices. By integrating structure analysis, transport measurements and electronic structure calculation, we validate that carriers are localized to a few dots owing to the heterogeneity of the epitaxial inter-dot connections. Importantly, our analysis shows that complete delocalization is possible with optimized dot-to-dot bonding, thereby providing a path forward to create quantum dot solids in which theoretically predicted properties can be realized.},

In Max Cal, you maximize a path entropy over all possible pathways, subject to dynamical constraints, in order to predict relative path weights. Many well-known relationships of Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics – such as the Green-Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relations, Onsager's reciprocal relations, and Prigogine's Minimum Entropy Production – are limited to near-equilibrium processes. Max Cal is more general. While it can readily derive these results under those limits, Max Cal is also applicable far from equilibrium. We give recent examples of MaxCal as a method of inference about trajectory distributions from limited data, finding reaction coordinates in bio-molecular simulations, and modeling the complex dynamics of non-thermal systems such as gene regulatory networks or the collective firing of neurons.

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

In this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex interpolation, basic linear algebra and the recently introduced R{\'{e}}nyi generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities.},

abstract = {Tensor networks provide a natural framework for exploring holographic dual-ity because they obey entanglement area laws. They have been used to construct explicit toy models realizing many of the interesting structural features of the AdS/CFT corre-spondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models naturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT correspondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that the entanglement entropy of all boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties of the multipartite entanglement of assistance. We also discuss the behavior of R{\'{e}}nyi entropies in our models and contrast it with AdS/CFT. Moreover, we find that each boundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement wedge, i.e., the bulk region enclosed by the boundary region and the minimal surface. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the partition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected cor-rections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the bulk minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface behavior topologically, in a way similar to the effect of creating a black hole. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily motivated by the AdS/CFT duality, the main results of the article define a more general form of bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to other spacetimes.},

abstract = {The main topic of this thesis is the proof of two fundamental entropic inequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels model the propagation of electromagnetic waves through optical fibers and free space in the quantum regime, and provide the mathematical model to determine the maximum rates achievable by quantum communication devices for communication and quantum key distribution. The first inequality proven in this thesis is the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, which provides a lower bound to the output entropy of the beam-splitter or of the squeezing in terms of the entropies of the two inputs. The second inequality states that Gaussian states minimize the output entropy of the one-mode quantum Gaussian attenuator among all the input states with a given entropy, and was a longstanding conjecture in quantum communication theory. The generalization of this inequality to the multimode attenuator would determine its triple trade-off region and its capacity region for broadcast communication to two receivers. The thesis contains further results in Gaussian quantum information, quantum statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum information. The most important of these results concerns the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH is an assumption in quantum statistical mechanics stating that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a system+bath compound look as thermal states if we can access only the system. We prove that the ETH must hold if the system thermalizes for any initial product state of the system+bath compound with a well-defined temperature.},

In that way, all matrix elements of the Green's function matrix can be analytically continued; we introduce a computationally cheap element-wise method for this purpose. However, this method cannot ensure important constraints on the mathematical properties of the resulting spectral functions, namely positive semidefiniteness and Hermiticity. To improve on this, we present a full matrix formalism, where all matrix elements are treated simultaneously. We show the capabilities of these methods using insulating and metallic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) Green's functions as test cases. Finally, we apply the methods to realistic material calculations for LaTiO 3 , where off-diagonal matrix elements in the Green's function appear due to the distorted crystal structure.},

Quantifying the notion of pattern and formalizing the process of pattern discovery go right to the heart of physical science. Over the past few decades physics' view of nature's lack of structure—its unpredictability—underwent a major renovation with the discovery of deterministic chaos, overthrowing two centuries of Laplace's strict determinism in classical physics. Behind the veil of apparent randomness, though, many processes are highly ordered, following simple rules. Tools adapted from the theories of information and computation have brought physical science to the brink of automatically discovering hidden patterns and quantifying their structural complexity.},

Yet, the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answering important questions concerning d-wave superconductivity and quantum magnetism. Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Hamil-tonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It pro-vides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metal-lic, band-insulating, superfluid, and Mott-insulating regimes.},

abstract = {Uncertainty relations involving incompatible observables are one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics. Aside from their fundamental significance, they play an important role in practical applications, such as detection of quantum correlations and security requirements in quantum cryptography. In continuous variable systems, the spectra of the relevant observables form a continuum and this necessitates the coarse graining of measurements. However, these coarse-grained observables do not necessarily obey the same uncertainty relations as the original ones, a fact that can lead to false results when considering applications. That is, one cannot naively replace the original observables in the uncertainty relation for the coarse-grained observables and expect consistent results. As such, several uncertainty relations that are specifically designed for coarse-grained observables have been developed. In recognition of the 90th anniversary of the seminal Heisenberg uncertainty relation, celebrated last year, and all the subsequent work since then, here we give a review of the state of the art of coarse-grained uncertainty relations in continuous variable quantum systems, as well as their applications to fundamental quantum physics and quantum information tasks. Our review is meant to be balanced in its content, since both theoretical considerations and experimental perspectives are put on an equal footing.},

Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entangle-ment along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed in [1].},

@article{Blickle2006,
abstract = {We study the motion of an overdamped colloidal particle in a time-dependent nonharmonic potential. We demonstrate the first lawlike balance between applied work, exchanged heat, and internal energy on the level of a single trajectory. The observed distribution of applied work is distinctly non-Gaussian in good agreement with numerical calculations. Both the Jarzynski relation and a detailed fluctuation theorem are verified with good accuracy. Since more than a century, the first law relating the work applied to a system with both the exchanged heat and an increase in internal energy is one of the cornerstones of macroscopic physics. Its consistent formulation for a mesoscopic system like a driven colloidal particle, however , was suggested only about a decade ago [1]. Since on these scales thermal fluctuations are relevant, probability distributions for work, heat, and internal energy replace the sharp values of their macroscopic counterparts. Various theoretical relations like the fluctuation theorem [2,3], the Jarzynski relation [4], and the Hatano-Sasa relation [5] involving these distributions in different settings extend the second law to the mesoscopic realm at least as long as the notion of a constant temperature of the ambient heat bath remains meaningful [for a review, see [6]]. Such theorems have been tested experimentally using both bio-molecules manipulated mechanically [7,8] as well as col-loidal particles in time dependent laser traps [9-11]. Common to all colloidal experiments, so far, is that these laser traps generate a harmonic potential albeit with a time-dependent center or ''spring constant.'' Consequently, often the interesting distributions are Gaussian even though for certain quantities non-Gaussian distributions can occur [10,12]. In this Letter, we study the thermodynamics of single colloidal trajectories in a time-dependent nonharmonic potential which, generically, gives rise to non-Gaussian distributions. Only for very short or very long trajectories, one expects Gaussian distributions even in this nonhar-monic case [13]. In particular, we identify applied work, exchanged heat, and change in internal energy along a single trajectory and thus test the consistency of these notions on this level, or, put differently, illustrate the validity of the first law. We measure the distribution of work in the non-Gaussian regime and compare it to theoretical prediction. Such a comparison does not involve a single fit parameter since all quantities are measured independently , which is another advantage of colloidal systems. Finally, we test the Jarzynski relation which expresses the free energy difference between two equilibrium states in terms of the nonequilibrium work spent in the transition between the two states. Such an illustration of the Jarzynski relation in the non-Gaussian regime comes timely given ongoing theoretical criticism of its validity [14,15]. In our study, particle trajectories were determined using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM), where a single colloidal particle is illuminated under evanescent field conditions. This field is created by total internal reflection of a laser beam at a glass-water interface. The scattered intensity of a bead near the interface is proportional to exp{\"{y}}z, with {\"{y}}1 the decay length of the evanescent field and z the particle-wall distance [16]. Measuring the scattered intensity of a fluctuating Brownian particle as a function of time thus yields its vertical position with a spatial resolution of about 5 nm. We used an aqueous suspension of highly charged polystyrene beads with radius R  2 m, which were illuminated with light of wavelength  658:5 nm. The particle concentration was sufficiently low to guarantee that there was only a single particle within the field of view. The penetration depth was adjusted to {\"{y}}1 ' 200 nm and the scattered intensity was monitored with a photomultiplier at a data acquisition rate of  2 kHz. An additional fo-cused laser beam ( 1064 nm, power P ' 2 mW) was directed vertically from the top, which confined the particle motion to an one-dimensional trajectory in z direction. To drive the colloidal particle between two equilibrium states, it was subjected to the light pressure of another optical tweezers ( 532 nm, beam waist about 17 m, P 60 mW), which was incident from below into the sample cell (lower tweezers, see inset of Fig. 1). The intensity of this laser beam was varied with an electro-optical modulator connected to a computer-controlled waveform generator. We modulated the laser intensity according to a time-dependent symmetric protocol I  It s {\"{y}}  in the time interval 0 t s , where t s is the pulse duration (see Fig. 2) [17]. To ensure that the system is out of equilibrium, t s must be smaller than the particle relaxation time t r ' 480 ms.},

abstract = {It has been conjectured that transport in integrable one-dimensional systems is necessarily ballistic. The large diffusive response seen experimentally in nearly ideal realizations of the S ¼ 1=2 1D Heisenberg model is therefore puzzling and has not been explained so far. Here, we show that, contrary to common belief, diffusion is universally present in interacting 1D systems subject to a periodic lattice potential. We present a parameter-free formula for the spin-lattice relaxation rate which is in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we calculate the current decay directly in the thermodynamic limit using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm and show that an anomalously large time scale exists even at high temperatures. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.216602 PACS numbers: 72.10.{\`{A}}d, 05.10.Cc, 05.60.Gg, 75.40.Gb For a generic system of interacting particles at suffi-ciently high temperatures, transport is expected to be scat-tering limited. In d spatial dimensions, the signature of diffusive motion is the characteristic long-time decay of the autocorrelation function hn r ðtÞn r ð0Þi {\$} t {\`{A}}d=2 . Here, n r represents the density of a globally conserved quantity P r n r . In very clean systems, however, transport can be a subtle issue because constants of motion may slow down the current decay or even prevent currents from decaying completely. An important role in our understanding of strongly correlated electrons is played by integrable quan-tum models. Since these models possess an infinite number of local conserved quantities, one might expect ideal (bal-listic) transport to be the rule rather than the exception [1]. Whether or not diffusive behavior is possible at all in such systems is indeed an intensely studied [1–13] but still open question. Experimentally, the question if spin diffusion holds in Heisenberg chains has been investigated for dec-ades [14–17]. In the thermodynamic limit, ballistic transport can be defined from the condition that the current-current corre-lation function hJ ðtÞJ ð0Þi, where J is the spatial integral of the current density operator and the brackets denote thermal average, does not decay to zero at large times. This happens, for example, in a free electron gas, where J is proportional to the momentum operator and therefore conserved in a translationally invariant system [13]. The dc conductivity is then infinite. Next, we consider the case where the current operator itself is not conserved but a conserved quantity Q exists which has finite overlap with J . We can then write J ¼ J k þ J ? , with J k ¼ ðhJ Qi=hQ 2},

It has been suggested that it evolved as part of a larger adaptation of humans' species-unique forms of cooperation. Although our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, show general cooperative abilities, their communicative interactions seem to lack the cooperative nature of human conversation. Here, we revisited this claim by conducting the first systematic comparison of communicative interactions in mother-infant dyads living in two different communities of bonobos (LuiKotale, DRC; Wamba, DRC) and chimpanzees (Ta{\"{i}} South, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire; Kanyawara, Uganda) in the wild. Focusing on the communicative function of joint-travel-initiation, we applied parameters of conversation analysis to gestural exchanges between mothers and infants. Results showed that communicative exchanges in both species resemble cooperative turn-taking sequences in human conversation. While bonobos consistently addressed the recipient via gaze before signal initiation and used so-called overlapping responses, chimpanzees engaged in more extended negotiations, involving frequent response waiting and gestural sequences. Our results thus strengthen the hypothesis that interactional intelligence paved the way to the cooperative endeavour of human language and suggest that social matrices highly impact upon communication styles.},

These can be thought of as operators that create a particle, together with its inseparable gravitational field, and reduce to usual field operators of quantum field theory in the weak-gravity limit; they include both Wilson-line operators and those creating a Coulombic field configuration. We also describe operators creating the field of a particle in motion; as in the electromagnetic case, these are expected to help address infrared problems. An important characteristic of the quantum theory of gravity is the algebra of its observables. We show that the commutators of the simple observables of this paper are nonlocal, with nonlocality becoming significant in strong field regions, as predicted previously on general grounds.},

Exploiting the recursive drive structure, we can efficiently simulate exponentially long times. After an initial transient, the system exhibits a long-lived glassy regime characterized by a logarithmically slow growth of entanglement and decay of correlations analogous to the dynamics at the many-body delocalization transition. Ultimately, at long time scales, which diverge exponentially for weak or rapid drives, the system thermalizes to infinite temperature. The slow relaxation enables metastable dynamical phases, exemplified by a " time quasicrystal " in which spins exhibit persistent oscillations with a distinct quasiperiodic pattern from that of the drive. We show that in contrast with Floquet systems, a high-frequency expansion strictly breaks down above fourth order, and fails to produce an effective static Hamiltonian that would capture the prethermal glassy relaxation.},

abstract = {It is argued that a typical many-body energy eigenstate has a well-defined thermodynamic entropy and that individual eigenstates possess thermodynamic characteristics analogous to those of generic isolated systems. We examine large systems with eigenstate energies equivalent to finite temperatures. When quasi-static evolution of a system is adiabatic (in the quantum mechanical sense), two coupled subsystems can transfer heat from one subsystem to another and yet remain in an energy eigenstate. To explicitly construct the entropy from the wave function, degrees of freedom are divided into two unequal parts. It is argued that the entanglement entropy between these two subsystems is the thermodynamic entropy per degree of freedom for the smaller subsystem. This is done by tracing over the larger subsystem to obtain a density matrix and calculating the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the entanglement entropy.},

abstract = {This review is devoted to the problem of thermalization in a small isolated conglomerate of interacting constituents. A variety of physically important systems of intensive current interest belong to this category: complex atoms, molecules (including biological molecules), nuclei, small devices of condensed matter and quantum optics on nano- and micro-scale, cold atoms in optical lattices, ion traps. Physical implementations of quantum computers, where there are many interacting qubits, also fall into this group. Statistical regularities come into play through inter-particle interactions, which have two fundamental components: mean field, that along with external conditions, forms the regular component of the dynamics, and residual interactions responsible for the complex structure of the actual stationary states. At sufficiently high level density, the stationary states become exceedingly complicated superpositions of simple quasiparticle excitations. At this stage, regularities typical of quantum chaos emerge and bring in signatures of thermalization. We describe all the stages and the results of the processes leading to thermalization, using analytical and massive numerical examples for realistic atomic, nuclear, and spin systems, as well as for models with random parameters. The structure of stationary states, strength functions of simple configurations, and concepts of entropy and temperature in application to isolated mesoscopic systems are discussed in detail. We conclude with a schematic discussion of the time evolution of such systems to equilibrium.},

The possibility of developing such a theory is discussed, as well as its theoretical and cosmological relevance. The connection between this problem and the problem of physical time in (compact space) general relativity is emphasized. The idea that a preferred physical time variable is singled out by the statistical properties of the state is proposed. A scheme for a generally covariant statistical thermodynamics is put forward, by extending the Gibbs formalism to the presymplectic, or constrained, dynamical systems. This scheme is based on three equations. The first characterizes any statistical state; the second is the definition of a vector flow in terms of the statistical state; the third is an intrinsic definition of equilibrium. The vector flow of an equilibrium state is denoted thermodynamical time, and the suggestion is made that thermodynamical time is the internal time that carries all the 'common sense' characterizations of the notion of time. Finally, it is suggested that the issue of the second law of the thermodynamics could be reconsidered within this generally covariant framework.},

abstract = {We report the experimental reconstruction of the nonequilibrium work probability distribution in a closed quantum system, and the study of the corresponding quantum fluctuation relations. The experiment uses a liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance platform that offers full control on the preparation and dynamics of the system. Our endeavors enable the characterization of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum spin from a finite-time thermodynamics viewpoint. Research on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems has so far produced important statements on the thermodynamics of small systems undergoing quantum mechanical evolutions [1,2]. Key examples are provided by the Crooks and Jarzynski relations [3,4]: taking into account fluctuations in nonequilibrium dynamics, such relations connect equilibrium properties of thermodynam-ical relevance with explicit nonequilibrium features. Although the experimental study of such fundamental relations in the classical domain has encountered considerable success [5-9], their quantum mechanical versions [10] require the assessment of the statistics of work performed by or onto an evolving quantum system, a step that has so far shown hurdles due to the practical difficulty to perform reliable projective measurements of instantaneous energy states [2,11], which embodies a key experimental challenge. Albeit a few interesting proposals to overcome such bottlenecks have been made [11,12], including an ingenious calorimetric one [13], the experimental reconstruction of the work statistics for a quantum protocol has so far remained elusive. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has been devised, based on well-known interfero-metric schemes of the estimation of phases in quantum systems, which bypasses the necessity of direct projective measurements on the instantaneous state for the system [14,15] (see Ref. [16] for an interesting development of the original proposal). In this Letter we exploit such a scheme to study the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics of a spin-1=2 system undergoing a closed quantum nonadiabatic evolution, realized in a liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) setup [17-22], and thus achieve sufficient information to assess both the Tasaki-Crooks and Jarzynski identities. To the best of our knowledge, our Letter reports the first experimental assessment of fluctuation relations for quantum dynamics. Work statistics in the quantum domain.-When addressing quantum dynamics, the concept of work done by or on a system needs to be reformulated [23] so as to include ab initio both the inherent nondeterministic nature of quantum evolution and the effects of quantum fluctuations. In this sense, work acquires a meaning only as a statistical variable W. In order to introduce the associated probability distribution, let us consider a quantum system undergoing a transformation that changes its Hamiltonian asˆHð0Þasˆ asˆHð0Þ → ˆ Hð$\tau$Þ in a time $\tau$. We refer to this as the forward protocol, with corresponding distribution P F ðWÞ ¼ P n;m p 0 n p $\tau$ mjn $\delta$½W − ð¯ ϵ m − ϵ n Þ [23]. We have introduced the probability p 0 n to find the system in the nth eigenstate ofˆHð0Þofˆ ofˆHð0Þ (with energy ϵ n) at the start of the protocol, and the transition probability p $\tau$ m|n to find it in the mth eigenstate ofˆHð$\tau$Þofˆ ofˆHð$\tau$Þ (with energy ¯ ϵ m) at time $\tau$ if it were in the nth state at initial time. One can then define a backward protocol that implements the transformationˆHð$\tau$Þ transformationˆ transformationˆHð$\tau$Þ → ˆ Hð0Þ with an inverted control sequence. It is worth mentioning that recent years have seen the proposal of other formulations of quantum work that explicitly bypass the two-time energy measurements illustrated above [24]. While the initial state of the system can be arbitrary, in this Letter we will be concerned with initial thermal-equilibrium states at a given temperature. Moreover, it is often convenient to use the Fourier transform of the work distribution, or},

abstract = {Thermodynamic entropy, as defined by Clausius, characterizes macroscopic observations of a system based on phenomenological quantities such as temperature and heat. In contrast, information-theoretic entropy, introduced by Shannon, is a measure of uncertainty. In this Letter, we connect these two notions of entropy, using an axiomatic framework for thermodynamics [E. H. Lieb and J. Yngvason Proc. R. Soc. 469, 20130408 (2013)]. In particular, we obtain a direct relation between the Clausius entropy and the Shannon entropy, or its generalization to quantum systems, the von Neumann entropy. More generally, we find that entropy measures relevant in nonequilibrium thermodynamics correspond to entropies used in one-shot information theory. Entropy plays a central role both in thermodynamics and in information theory. This is remarkable, as the two theories appear to be fundamentally different. Thermodynamics is a phenomenological theory concerned with the description of large physical systems, such as steam engines or fridges. It relies on concepts like work or heat, which are defined in terms of macroscopic observables. Information theory, on the other hand, deals with "knowledge" on a rather abstract level. Like statistical mechanics, it refers to the microscopic states of a system, such as the values of the individual bits stored in a memory device. Accordingly, the notion of entropy is rather different in the two theories. In thermodynamics, entropy is a function of the macroscopic state of a physical system that describes phenomenologically which processes are possible independently of any microscopic model. Following Clausius, it is conventionally defined in terms of the heat transfer into a system at a given temperature, and it lends its operational significance from the second law [1,2]. In information theory, entropy was originally introduced by Shannon to quantify the information content of data or, equivalently, the uncertainty one has about them [3]. Operationally, it characterizes properties such as the compression length, i.e., the minimum number of bits needed to store the data. Mathematically, the Shannon entropy is a function of the probability distribution of the random variable that models the data. The von Neumann entropy [4] provides a generalization of this concept to the case where information is represented by the state of a quantum-mechanical system. The information theoretic entropy is formally equivalent to the entropy function from statistical mechanics. This relation is conceptually justified through Landauer's principle [5-7]. It entails that the loss of information in an erasure operation on a system, and, hence, the decrease of its information-theoretic entropy, is paired with a heat dissipation in the system's environment. Arguments for Landauer's principle start from microscopic considerations, for example, using standard tools from statistical mechanics [8-10], or explicit microscopic models inspired from information theory [11-21]. An alternative view on the conceptual connection of these entropy measures was proposed by Jaynes in terms of his maximum entropy principle [22]. See also Refs. [6,23-26] for a selection of related approaches. In this Letter, we take a different approach: we show that the information-theoretic entropy results from applying the definition of thermodynamic entropy to quantum resource theories. This connection is not based on a model borrowed from one particular theory, instead it relates the theory of information to that of phenomenological thermodynamics on an axiomatic level. Our approach relies on a framework by Lieb and Yngvason [27-30], who give a derivation of thermodynam-ics, and, in particular, of the thermodynamic entropy, based on abstract axioms. These axioms identify basic properties of a thermodynamic system, which we find to be also fulfilled in the context of resource theories. As a consequence, there is also in this context a state function analogous to the thermodynamic entropy. As we show, the state function in question is none else than the information-theoretic entropy itself. This provides a novel connection between the thermo-dynamic and information-theoretic entropies. In particular, this connection extends to the min-and max-entropy, "single-shot" generalizations of the von Neumann entropy. These have been introduced to characterize single},

abstract = {We give a derivation of Holevo's bound using an important result from nonequilibrium statistical physics, the fluctuation theorem. To do so we develop a general formalism of quantum fluctuation theorems for two-time measurements, which explicitly accounts for the back action of quantum measurements as well as possibly nonunitary time evolution. For a specific choice of observables this fluctuation theorem yields a measurement-dependent correction to the Holevo bound, leading to a tighter inequality. We conclude by analyzing equality conditions for the improved bound. Thermodynamics and information theory are intimately connected. The most prominent evidence for this relationship is that the Clausius entropy [1] is given by the Shannon information [2] in systems at thermal equilibrium [3]. In particular, Landauer's principle [4,5] illustrates that information is a physical, measurable quantity. Thermodynamic work has to be performed in order to create or erase information. Landauer's principle can therefore be understood as a statement of the second law of thermodynamics in an information theoretic context. This is also true for Holevo's bound [6], which limits the amount of classical information that can be encoded in a generic quantum system. Recently, nanodevices, for which these principles are directly applicable, have become experimentally accessible [7]. These controlled quantum systems have applications ranging from quantum simulation [8,9], cryptography [10], and computing [11-13] to metrology [14-17]. The main obstacles towards realization of such devices are control noise and interactions with the environment. Thus, a thermodynamic study is necessary to fully understand their information theoretic properties. However, most nanodevices operate far from thermal equilibrium, so tools from nonequilibrium statistical physics are required. In recent years, formulations of the second law have been derived which are valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium. These so-called fluctuation theorems, in particular, the Jarzynski equality [18], enable the calculation of equilibrium quantities from nonequi-librium averages over many realizations of a single process. They also encompass nonequilibrium, information-theoretic generalizations of the second law. As Landauer's principle is a direct implication of this approach [19-21], one may ask whether Holevo's bound is also such a result. One complication in this case is that the approach to fluctuation theorems for quantum systems is mathematically and conceptually more involved. Thermodynamic quantities, which are not given as state functions, cannot be assigned a Hermitian operator [22]. The proper formulation of quantum thermodynamics for nonequilibrium systems, especially quantum fluctuation theorems [23], must therefore be treated with care. The purpose of the present Brief Report is twofold. In the first part we derive a general quantum fluctuation theorem that accounts for the back action of measurements on reduced systems (see Ref. [24] for a similar approach). To this end, we consider an experimental point of view; we assume that the system of interest is coupled to an environment which is experimentally inaccessible. Such measurements on open quantum systems are inherently incomplete since they ignore environmental degrees of freedom. Information is lost that, in principle, could have been acquired by concurrent measurement of the reservoir. A general formulation of quantum fluctuation theorems must explicitly account for these effects. The integral fluctuation theorem we derive is applicable to arbitrary orthogonal measurements for systems undergoing both unitary and nonunitary dynamics. In the second part we focus on an information-theoretic consequence of the general quantum fluctuation theorem: Holevo's theorem. The derivation and implications of this result have attracted much attention [25-29]. Like more recent works [30-32], our derivation results in a sharpened statement of Holevo's bound, which takes into account the choice of measurement used to obtain the encoded information. Further our treatment is based on results weaker than the monotonicity of relative entropy and directly leads to necessary and sufficient equality conditions. This illustrates an interesting connection between quantum thermodynamics and quantum information theory. General quantum fluctuation theorem. Consider a time-dependent quantum system S with Hilbert space H S and initial density matrix $\rho$ 0. Information about the state of the system is obtained by performing measurements on S at the beginning and end of a specific process. Initially, a quantum measurement is made of observable A i , with eigenvalues a i m. Letting i m denote the orthogonal projectors into the eigenspaces of A i , we have A i = m a i m i m. Note that the eigenvalues {\{}a i m {\}} can be degenerate, so the projectors {\{} i m {\}} may have a rank greater than 1. Unlike the classical case, as long as $\rho$ 0 and A i do not have a common set of eigenvectors, i.e., they do not commute, performing a measurement on S alters its statistics. Measuring a i m maps $\rho$ 0 to the state i m $\rho$ 0 i m /p m , where p m = tr{\{} i m $\rho$ 0 i m {\}} is the probability of the measurement outcome a i m. Generally accounting for all possible measurement outcomes, the statistics of S after the measurement are given by the weighted average of all projections, M i ($\rho$ 0) = m i m $\rho$ 0 i m.

abstract = {Characterizing out-of-equilibrium many-body dynamics is a complex but crucial task for quantum applications and understanding fundamental phenomena. A central question is the role of localization in quenching thermalization in many-body systems and whether such localization survives in the presence of interactions. Probing this question in real systems necessitates the development of an experimentally measurable metric that can distinguish between different types of localization. While it is known that the localized phase of interacting systems [many-body localization (MBL)] exhibits a long-time logarithmic growth in entanglement entropy that distinguishes it from the noninteracting case of Anderson localization (AL), entanglement entropy is difficult to measure experimentally. Here, we present a novel correlation metric, capable of distinguishing MBL from AL in high-temperature spin systems. We demonstrate the use of this metric to detect localization in a natural solid-state spin system using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We engineer the natural Hamiltonian to controllably introduce disorder and interactions, and observe the emergence of localization. In particular, while our correlation metric saturates for AL, it slowly keeps increasing for MBL, demonstrating analogous features to entanglement entropy, as we show in simulations. Our results show that our NMR techniques, akin to measuring out-of-time correlations, are well suited for studying localization in spin systems.},

abstract = {Classical ratchet potentials, which alternate a driving potential with periodic random dissipative motion, can account for the operation of biological motors. We demonstrate the operation of a quantum ratchet, which differs from classical ratchets in that dissipative processes are absent within the observation time of the system (Hamiltonian regime). An atomic rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate is exposed to a sawtooth-like optical lattice potential, whose amplitude is periodically modulated in time. The ratchet transport arises from broken spatiotemporal symmetries of the driven potential, resulting in a desymmetrization of transporting eigenstates (Floquet states). The full quantum character of the ratchet transport was demonstrated by the measured atomic current oscillating around a nonzero stationary value at longer observation times, resonances occurring at positions determined by the photon recoil, and dependence of the transport current on the initial phase of the driving potential.},

abstract = {A central problem in fundamental physics is to witness the non-classicality of systems whose dynamics is not completely specified. For example, this arises in testing predictions that a macroscopic system, such as a living system, obeys quantum theory. Notoriously, also, it has been claimed that witnessing non-classicality in the gravitational field is practically impossible. Here, we propose a thought experiment that witnesses the non-classicality of a physical system by probing it with a qubit, without having to assume any specific dynamics on the physical system. Remarkably, this experiment does not require any quantum control of the system, involving only measuring a single classical observable on it. That non-classicality of a system can be established indirectly, by coupling it to a qubit, opens up exciting possibilities, for example, that quantum gravitational effects might be witnessed in the lab.},

abstract = {The predictive information required for proper trajectory sampling of a stochastic process can be more efficiently transmitted via a quantum channel than a classical one. This recent discovery allows quantum information processing to drastically reduce the memory necessary to simulate complex classical stochastic processes. It also points to a new perspective on the intrinsic complexity that nature must employ in generating the processes we observe. The quantum advantage increases with codeword length: the length of process sequences used in constructing the quantum communication scheme. In analogy with the classical complexity measure, statistical complexity, we use this reduced communication cost as an entropic measure of state complexity in the quantum representation. Previously difficult to compute, the quantum advantage is expressed here in closed form using spectral decomposition. This allows for efficient numerical computation of the quantum-reduced state complexity at all encoding lengths, including infinite. Additionally, it makes clear how finite-codeword reduction in state complexity is controlled by the classical process's cryptic order, and it allows asymptotic analysis of infinite-cryptic-order processes.},

This is not so surprising, as classical and quantum physics are descriptive frameworks built on different assumptions that capture, emphasize, and express different properties and mechanisms. What is surprising is that, as we demonstrate, simplicity is ambiguous: the relative simplicity between two systems can change sign when moving between classical and quantum descriptions. Here, we associate simplicity with small model-memory. We see that the notions of absolute physical simplicity at best form a partial, not a total, order. This suggests that appeals to principles of physical simplicity, via Ockham's Razor or to the " elegance " of competing theories, may be fundamentally subjective. Recent rapid progress in quantum computation and quantum simulation suggest that the ambiguity of simplicity will strongly impact statistical inference and, in particular, model selection.},

We show furthermore that the same reduction of complexity applies to operators that have a high-temperature autocorrelation function which decays slower than exponential, i.e., with a power law.

Nonetheless, all observers agree that interactions are local in the spacetime coordinates constructed by observers local to them. This framework, in which absolute locality is replaced by relative locality, results from deforming momentum space, just as the passage from absolute to relative simultaneity results from deforming the linear addition of velocities. Different aspects of momentum space geometry, such as its curvature, torsion and non-metricity, are reflected in different kinds of deformations of the energy-momentum conservation laws. These are in principle all measurable by appropriate experiments. We also discuss a natural set of physical hypotheses which singles out the cases of momentum space with a metric compatible connection and constant curvature.},

So far, theoretical studies of the transition have focused mainly on the case of true-random disorder. In this work, we experimentally and numerically investigate the regime close to the many-body localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. We find slow relaxation of the density imbalance close to the transition, strikingly similar to the behavior near the transition in true-random systems.

The labels of the state are written in terms of two unit vectors, a spin and an angle for each link of the graph. The heat-kernel time is chosen to be a function of the spin. These labels are the ones used in the spin-foam setting and admit a clear geometric interpretation. Moreover, the set of labels per link can be written as an element of SLð2; CÞ. These states coincide with Thiemann's coherent states with the area operator as complexifier. We study the properties of semiclassicality of these states and show that, for large spins, they reproduce a superposition over spins of spin-networks with nodes labeled by Livine-Speziale coherent intertwiners.

abstract = {I discuss the impact of gauge-gravity duality on our understanding of two classes of systems: conformal quantum matter and compressible quantum matter. The first conformal class includes systems, such as the boson Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions, which display quantum critical points described by conformal field theories. Questions asso-ciated with nonzero temperature dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field-theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically using gauge-gravity duality and discuss the prospects for reliable computation of low-frequency correlations. Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the charge density, associated with a global U(1) sym-metry, upon a chemical potential. Familiar examples are solids, super-fluids, and Fermi liquids, but there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied using gauge-gravity duality and discuss their relationship to the condensed matter classification of such states. The gravity methods offer hope of a deeper understanding of exotic and strongly coupled compressible quantum states.},

The measures defined, admitting computable expressions for any finite Hilbert-space dimension, are based on probabilistic averages and arise naturally from the viewpoint of coherence as a resource. We investigate how the capability of a dephasing process (e.g., a nonselective orthogonal measurement) to generate coherence depends on the relevant bases of the Hilbert space over which coherence is quantified and the dephasing process occurs, respectively. We extend our analysis to include those Lindblad time evolutions which, in the infinite-time limit, dephase the system under consideration and calculate their coherence-generating power as a function of time. We further identify specific families of such time evolutions that, although dephasing, have optimal (over all quantum processes) coherence-generating power for some intermediate time. Finally, we investigate the coherence-generating capability of random dephasing channels.},

These comprise chaotic and disordered systems, the localization problem, many-body quantum systems, the Calogero-Sutherland model, chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, and quantum gravity in two dimensions. The review is preceded by a brief historical survey of the developments of RMT and of localization theory since their inception. We emphasize the concepts common to the above-mentioned fields as well as the great diversity of RMT. In view of the universality of RMT, we suggest that the current development signals the emergence of a new “statistical mechanics”: Stochasticity and general symmetry requirements lead to universal laws not based on dynamical principles.},

@article{Wilming2017,
abstract = {One of the main questions of research on quantum many-body systems following unitary out of equilibrium dynamics is to find out how local expectation values equilibrate in time. For non-interacting models, this question is rather well understood. However, the best known bounds for general quantum systems are vastly crude, scaling unfavorable with the system size. Nevertheless, empirical and numerical evidence suggests that for generic interacting many-body systems, generic local observables, and sufficiently well-behaved states, the equilibration time does not depend strongly on the system size, but only the precision with which this occurs does. In this discussion paper, we aim at giving very simple and plausible arguments for why this happens. While our discussion does not yield rigorous results about equilibration time scales, we believe that it helps to clarify the essential underlying mechanisms, the intuition and important figure of merits behind equilibration. We then connect our arguments to common assumptions and numerical results in the field of equilibration and thermalization of closed quantum systems, such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as rigorous results on interacting quantum many-body systems. Finally, we complement our discussions with numerical results - both in the case of examples and counter-examples of equilibrating systems.},

abstract = {The problem of electron-electron lifetime in a quantum dot is studied beyond perturbation theory by mapping onto the problem of localization in the Fock space. Localized and delocalized regimes are identified, corresponding to quasiparticle spectral peaks of zero and finite width, respectively. In the localized regime, quasiparticle states are single-particle-like. In the delocalized regime, each eigenstate is a superposition of states with very different quasiparticle content. The transition energy is e c Ӎ D͑g͞ ln g͒ 1͞2 , where D is mean level spacing, and g is the dimensionless conductance. Near e c there is a broad critical region not described by the golden rule. [S0031-9007(97)02895-0] PACS numbers: 72.15.Lh, 72.15.Rn, 73.23.–b Quasiparticle in a Fermi liquid is not an eigenstate: it decays into two quasiparticles and a hole. In an infinite clean system, by using the golden rule (GR), quasiparticle decay rate is estimated as g͑e͒ ϳ e 2 ͞e F , where e is quasi-particle energy and e F is Fermi energy [1]. However, in a finite system the eigenstate spectrum is discrete. In this case, quasiparticles may be viewed as wave packets con-structed of such states, the packet width being determined by the lifetime in an infinite system: de Ӎ g͑e͒. In this paper we attempt to clarify the relation between quasipar-ticles and many-particle states, and find that at different energies it has different meanings. Conventionally, quasiparticles are well defined pro-vided g͑e͒ {\o} e. However, to resolve quasiparticles in a mesoscopic system, a more stringent condition is required: g͑e͒ , D, the quasiparticle level spacing. As an exam-ple, consider quasiparticle peaks in tunneling conductance of a quantum dot [2,3]. The peaks observed in nonlinear conductance at certain bias are interpreted as the quasipar-ticle tunneling density of states (DOS). Each peak corre-sponds to a " quasiparticle state, " and its width measures the lifetime of the state. Below we consider an isolated Fermi liquid, ignoring any contributions to the quasiparti-cle decay due to finite escape rate, phonons, etc. [4]. The meaning of quasiparticle lifetime needs clarifica-tion: strictly speaking, since a quantum dot is a finite sys-tem, any many-particle eigenstate gives rise to an infinitely narrow conductance peak. However, we will see that only a small fraction of those states overlap with one-particle excitations strongly enough to be detected by a finite sensi-tivity measurement. Under certain conditions, these strong peaks group into clusters of the width ϳg͑e͒ that can be interpreted as quasiparticle peaks. Before discussing possible regimes let us review the GR approach. Recently Sivan et al. [5], adopting the quasiparticle picture to a finite size geometry and relying on the earlier work [6] on electron-electron scattering rate in diffusive conductors, found that g͑e͒ ഠ D͑e͞gD͒ 2 , e , gD , (1) where D is the mean single-particle level spacing near the Fermi level and g ¿ 1 is the dimensionless conductance, for a finite system defined by g ෇ E c ͞D, where E c is the Thouless energy (inverse time of diffusion through the system). The decay rate (1) is much larger than in a clean Fermi liquid; however, at e , E c one has g͑e͒ {\o} D, implying that the quasiparticle states can be resolved. However, the GR can be used to evaluate lifetime only when the density of final states is sufficiently large, so that the GR decay rate is larger than the level spacing of final unperturbed states. Otherwise, the GR will not give the decay rate, but rather just a first-order perturbation correction to the energy of a given eigenstate. In our problem, it is important to realize that, since a quasiparticle decays into three quasiparticles, the density of relevant final states, n 3 ͑e͒ ෇ e},

This allows us to draw a detailed map of where in the landscape the MUB triplets are situated. We use available tools, such as the theory of the discrete Fourier transform, to organize our results. Finally, we present some evidence for the conjecture that there exists a four dimen-sional family of complex Hadamard matrices of order 6. If this conjecture is true the landscape in which one may search for MUBs is much larger than previously thought.},

abstract = {family formation predict that the memory of spin of the original unshattered parent body is lost 3 , and existing models of spin angular momentum suggest that collisional evolution randomizes asteroid spin vectors regardless of their initial orientations 2 , although the absolute timescale is uncertain. Here, I briefly identify two possible general explanations for future study. One possibility is that randomly oriented gravitational aggregates from the initial collision have further fragmented, creating smaller objects that have the same spin obliquities as the remnants from which they were formed. Secondary fragmentation of the largest remnant of the initial break-up has previously been proposed to explain the existence of several objects of comparable size among the largest Koronis family members 16 , but if the spin clusters were formed in this way then the absence of obvious corresponding associations in proper orbital elements also needs to be explained. To test this hypothesis, further work is needed to better understand the behaviour and evolution of gravitational aggregates. A second possible explanation for spin clusters is that some dynamical process is aligning the obliquities and matching the rotation rates. Thermal effects can change obliquities and spin rates of small irregular asteroids, but calculations for Ida suggest that asteroids of comparable size are unlikely to have been sub-stantially affected 17 . If a secular effect has clustered the spin vectors, then the present understanding of the timescale over which thermal processes have affected the spin cluster objects may be incomplete, or some nonthermal process may be at work. Finding similar clustering of spins for 20–40-km asteroids outside the Koronis family would support the hypothesis of a secular effect. A., Farinella, P. {\&} Froeschle, C.

In equilibrium this entropy coincides with the conventional von Neumann entropy S n = {\`{A}}Trq ln q. However, in contrast to S n , the d-entropy is not con-served in time in closed Hamiltonian systems. If the system is ini-tially in stationary state then in accord with the second law of thermodynamics the d-entropy can only increase or stay the same. We also show that the d-entropy can be expressed through the energy distribution function and thus it is measurable, at least in principle. Under very generic assumptions of the locality of the Hamiltonian and non-integrability the d-entropy becomes a unique function of the average energy in large systems and auto-matically satisfies the fundamental thermodynamic relation. This relation reduces to the first law of thermodynamics for quasi-static processes. The d-entropy is also automatically conserved for adia-batic processes. We illustrate our results with explicit examples and show that S d behaves consistently with expectations from thermodynamics.},

abstract = {We report on low-temperature transport and electronic band structure of p-type Sb 2 Te 3 nanowires, grown by chemical vapor deposition. Magnetoresistance measurements unravel quantum interference phenomena, which depend on the cross-sectional dimensions of the nanowires. The observation of periodic Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations is attributed to transport in topologically protected surface states in the Sb 2 Te 3 nanowires. The study of universal conductance fluctuations demonstrates coherent transport along the Aharonov-Bohm paths encircling the rectangular cross-section of the nanowires. We use nanoscale angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on single nanowires (nano-ARPES) to provide direct experimental evidence on the nontrivial topological character of those surface states. The compiled study of the bandstructure and the magnetotransport response unambiguosly points out the presence of topologically protected surface states in the nanowires and their substantial contribution to the quantum transport effects, as well as the hole doping and Fermi velocity among other key issues. The results are consistent with the theoretical description of quantum transport in intrinsically doped quasi-one-dimensional topological insulator nanowires. Three-dimensional topological insulators (TI) such as Bi 2 Te 3 , Bi 2 Se 3 , or Sb 2 Te 3 1–3 constitute a new class of quan-tum materials with topologically protected metal-like surface states. For bulk crystals, a significant drawback arises from the presence of high carrier concentration due to intrinsic defects in the bulk, which mask the char-acteristic non-trivial topological surface transport. Mesoscopic structures such as ultra-thin films and nanowires (nanoribbons) have been envisaged as promising platforms to explore intrinsic surface states, whose decoupling from bulk states is enhanced due to the high surface-to-bulk ratio and the effective tuning of the Fermi level. Theoretical and experimental reports also point out the novel physics in TI nanowires, as well as at their interfac-ing with magnetic materials or superconductors, e.g. proximity effect, spin manipulation, and Majorana fermions 4–6},

@article{Brockherde2017,
abstract = {Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn–Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn–Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems. Machine learning allows electronic structure calculations to access larger system sizes and, in dynamical simulations, longer time scales. Here, the authors perform such a simulation using a machine-learned density functional that avoids direct solution of the Kohn-Sham equations.},

In the case of nonintegrable systems, our finite-size scaling shows that the ETH becomes valid in the thermodynamic limit and can serve as the underlying mechanism for ISI equilibration. In the case of integrable systems, however, indication of ISI equilibration has been observed despite the violation of the ETH.

abstract = {Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated here in a different way. It is, however, mathematically equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function $\psi$(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},

@article{Ding2016,
abstract = {One way to diagnose chaos in bipartite unitary channels is via the tripartite information of the corresponding Choi state, which for certain choices of the subsystems reduces to the negative conditional mutual information (CMI). We study this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify its role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the channel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between individual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does not imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply a type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs. When the CMI is maximal, we find that the residual channel from an individual input to an individual output is completely depolarizing when the other input is maximally mixed. However, we again find that this result is not robust. We also extend some of these results to the multipartite case and to the case of Haar-random pure input states. Finally, we look at the relationship between tripartite information and its Renyi-2 version which is directly related to out-of-time-order correlation functions. In particular, we demonstrate an arbitrarily large gap between the two quantities.},

@article{Nahum,
abstract = {Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for example, after a quantum quench, is a key problem in nonequilibrium quantum physics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the " entanglement tsunami " in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like ðtimeÞ 1=3 and are spatially correlated over a distance ∝ ðtimeÞ 2=3 . We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a " minimal cut " picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the " velocity " of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.},

@article{Pietracaprina2016,
abstract = {In this paper we analyze the predictions of the forward approximation in some models which exhibit an Anderson (single-body) or many-body localized phase. This approximation, which consists of summing over the amplitudes of only the shortest paths in the locator expansion, is known to overestimate the critical value of the disorder which determines the onset of the localized phase. Nevertheless, the results provided by the approximation become more and more accurate as the local coordination (dimensionality) of the graph, defined by the hopping matrix, is made larger. In this sense, the forward approximation can be regarded as a mean-field theory for the Anderson transition in infinite dimensions. The sum can be efficiently computed using transfer matrix techniques, and the results are compared with the most precise exact diagonalization results available. For the Anderson problem, we find a critical value of the disorder which is 0.9{\%} off the most precise available numerical value already in 5 spatial dimensions, while for the many-body localized phase of the Heisenberg model with random fields the critical disorder h c = 4.0 ± 0.3 is strikingly close to the most recent results obtained by exact diagonalization. In both cases we obtain a critical exponent $\nu$ = 1. In the Anderson case, the latter does not show dependence on the dimensionality, as it is common within mean-field approximations. We discuss the relevance of the correlations between the shortest paths for both the single-and many-body problems, and comment on the connections of our results with the problem of directed polymers in random medium.},

@article{Livine2013,
abstract = {We introduce the set of framed (convex) polyhedra with N faces as the symplectic quotient C 2N //SU(2). A framed polyhedron is then parametrized by N spinors living in C 2 satisfying suitable closure constraints and defines a usual convex polyhedron plus extra U(1) phases attached to each face. We show that there is a natural ac-tion of the unitary group U(N) on this phase space, which changes the shape of faces and allows to map any (framed) polyhedron onto any other with the same total (boundary) area. This identifies the space of framed polyhedra to the Grassmannian space U(N)/ (SU(2) × U(N − 2)). We show how to write averages of geometrical ob-servables (polynomials in the faces' area and the angles between them) over the ensemble of polyhedra (distributed uniformly with respect to the Haar measure on U(N)) as polynomial integrals over the unitary group and we provide a few methods to compute these integrals systematically. We also use the Itzykson-Zuber formula from matrix models as the generating function for these averages and correlations. In the quantum case, a canonical quantization of the framed polyhedron phase space leads to the Hilbert space of SU(2) intertwiners (or, in other words, SU(2)-invariant states in tensor products of irreducible representations). The total boundary area as well as the individual face areas are quantized as half-integers (spins), and the Hilbert spaces for fixed total area form irreducible representations of U(N). We de-fine semi-classical coherent intertwiner states peaked on classical framed polyhedra and transforming consistently under U(N) transformations. And we show how the U(N) character formula for unitary transformations is to be considered as an ex-tension of the Itzykson-Zuber to the quantum level and generates the traces of all polynomial observables over the Hilbert space of intertwiners. We finally apply the same formalism to two dimensions and show that classical (convex) polygons can be described in a similar fashion trading the unitary group for the orthogonal group. We conclude with a discussion of the possible (deformation) dynamics that one can define on the space of polygons or polyhedra. This work is a priori useful in the context of discrete geometry but it should hopefully also be relevant to (loop) quan-tum gravity in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions when the quantum geometry is defined in terms of gluing of (quantized) polygons and polyhedra.

These fluctuations are intrinsically related to the conductivity of the metal. We use single-spin qubits associated with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to probe Johnson noise in the vicinity of conductive silver films. Measurements of polycrystalline silver films over a range of distances (20 to 200 nanometers) and temperatures (10 to 300 kelvin) are consistent with the classically expected behavior of the magnetic fluctuations. However, we find that Johnson noise is markedly suppressed next to single-crystal films, indicative of a substantial deviation from Ohm's law at length scales below the electron mean free path. Our results are consistent with a generalized model that accounts for the ballistic motion of electrons in the metal, indicating that under the appropriate conditions, nearby electrodes may be used for controlling nanoscale optoelectronic, atomic, and solid-state quantum systems.},

The results of this theory are corroborated and intuitively explained with a phenomenological effective description of the critical point and of the " badly conducting " state found near the critical point on the delocalized side. The theory leads to the following sharp predictions: (i) The delocalized state established near the transition is a Griffiths phase, which exhibits sub-diffusive transport of conserved quantities and sub-ballistic spreading of entanglement. The anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ {\textless} 1/2 vanishes continuously at the critical point. The system does thermalize in this Griffiths phase. (ii) The many-body localization transition is controlled by a new kind of infinite randomness RG fixed point, where the broadly distributed scaling variable is closely related to the eigenstate entanglement entropy. Dynamically, the entanglement grows as ∼ log t at the critical point, as it also does in the localized phase. (iii) In the vicinity of the critical point the ratio of the entanglement entropy to the thermal entropy, and its variance (and in fact all moments) are scaling functions of L/$\xi$, where L is the length of the system and $\xi$ is the correlation length, which has a power-law divergence at the critical point.},

abstract = {Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons 1,2 . However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. This has recently stimulated theoretical effort, using Feynman's idea of a quantum simulator 3,4 , to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented 5–7 . Here we report the experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realizing (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the Schwinger model 8,9) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism 10,11 , describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron–positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields 12 in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which can be directly and efficiently implemented on an ion trap architecture 13 . We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle–antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulation of high-energy theories using atomic physics experiments—the long-term intention is to extend this approach to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Small-scale quantum computers exist today in the laboratory as programmable quantum devices 14 . In particular, trapped-ion quan-tum computers 13 provide a platform allowing a few hundred coherent quantum gates to act on a few qubits, with a clear roadmap towards scaling up these devices 4,15 . This provides the tools for universal digital quantum simulation 16 , where the time evolution of a quantum system is approximated as a stroboscopic sequence of quantum gates 17 . Here we show how this technology can be used to simulate the real-time dynamics of a minimal model of a lattice gauge theory, realizing the Schwinger model 8,9 as a one-dimensional quantum field theory with a chain of trapped ions (Fig. 1). Our few-qubit demonstration is a first step towards simulating real-time dynamics in gauge theories: such simulations are funda-mental for the understanding of many physical phenomena, including thermalization after heavy-ion collisions and pair creation studied at high-intensity laser facilities 6,18},

These correlations are quantified by parame-ters that are subject to the " concentration of measure " phenomenon, meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive consequence that there exist large sub-spaces in which all pure states are close to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negli-gible distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible compared to the size of the total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic. Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal superdense coding of quantum states.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are a versatile material in which many aspects of condensed matter physics come together. Recent discoveries have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our under-standing of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding of transport through nanotube devices. Unlike in conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular momentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and valley freedom. The interplay between the two is the focus of this review. The energy levels associated with each degree of freedom, and the spin-orbit coupling between them, are explained, together with their consequences for transport measurements through nanotube quantum dots. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers modifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read out spin and valley qubits and to measure the decay of these states through coupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon nanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron interactions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behavior. Interaction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in SU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads to Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states. This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in theory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, open questions for the field are also clearly stated. These advances position nanotubes as a leading system for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where electronic disorder and hyperfine interaction can both be reduced to a low level.},

abstract = {In three-level quantum systems, interference between two simultaneously driven excitation pathways can give rise to effects such as coherent population trapping 1,2 and electromagnetically induced transparency 3. The possibility to exploit these effects has made three-level systems a cornerstone of quantum optics. Coherent driving of the third available transition forms a closed-contour interaction (CCI), which yields fundamentally new phenomena, including phase-controlled coherent population trapping 4,5 and phase-controlled coherent population dynamics 6. Despite attractive prospects, prevalent dephasing in experimental systems suitable for CCI driving has made its observation elusive 7-10. Here, we exploit recently developed methods for coherent manipulation of nitrogen-vacancy electronic spins to implement and study highly coherent CCI driving of a single spin. Our experiments reveal phase-controlled quantum interference, reminiscent of electron dynamics on a closed loop threaded by a magnetic flux, which we synthesize from the driving-field phase 11. Owing to the nature of the dressed states created under CCI, we achieve nearly two orders of magnitude improvement of the dephasing times, even for moderate drive strengths. CCI driving constitutes a novel approach to coherent control of few-level systems, with potential for applications in quantum sensing or quantum information processing. Three-level systems, where two of the three available transitions are simultaneously and coherently driven, are used in applications ranging from light storage 12 and atomic clock frequency standards 13 to coherent quantum control 14-16. Further functionalities could be enabled by closing the interaction contour with a third driving field (Fig. 1a). This would lead to interfering excitation pathways in the system, which depend on the phase of the driving fields and may allow for phase control of electromagnetic susceptibilities or coherent population dynamics 6. Despite practical interest 4-6,16 , studying such phase dependence is severely complicated by selection rules that prevent CCI in most experimental systems. Indeed, for symmetry reasons, only two of three available transitions in a three-level system can be dipole-allowed for the same type of driving field. Earlier experiments exploited a combination of electric and magnetic dipole transitions to overcome this fundamental limitation and study phase-dependent coherent population trapping 7-10. However, in all of these systems, dephasing rates by far exceeded the rate of coherent manipulation, thereby preventing experimental observation of quantum coherent CCI dynamics thus far. Here, we overcome these limitations by exploiting recently developed ways to coherently drive the nitrogen-vacancy spin and implement CCI. We establish a strong influence of the driving-field phase on coherent spin dynamics and observe the non-reciprocal character of CCI in a single three-level system. Due to the unique nature of the emerging dressed states, our CCI scheme allows for a close to two order of magnitude enhancement of the NV's inhomo-geneous dephasing time. The negatively charged NV centre, a substitutional nitrogen atom next to a vacancy in the diamond lattice, forms an S = 1 spin system (Fig. 1a) in its orbital ground state. Conveniently, the NV spin can be initialized using optical spin pumping under green laser excitation and optically read out by virtue of its spin-dependent fluorescence 17. The NV's spin sublevels are |0〉 and |± 1〉 , where |m s 〉 are the eigenstates of the spin operator z along the NV's symmetry axis z (that is, = = m m m z s s s). In the absence of symmetry-breaking fields, the electronic spin states |± 1〉 are degenerate and shifted from |0〉 by a zero-field splitting D 0 = 2.87 GHz. Applying a static magnetic field B NV along z splits |± 1〉 by $\Delta$ Z = 2$\gamma$ NV B NV , with $\gamma$ NV = 2.8 MHz G-1 , and leads to the formation of the three-level '∇-system' that we study in this work (Fig. 1a) 18. Although each of the states |m s 〉 has additional nuclear degrees of freedom due to hyperfine coupling to the NV's 14 N nuclear spin, we restrict ourselves to the hyperfine subspace with nuclear spin quantum number m I = + 1 (ref. 19), while other states remain out of resonance with our driving fields and do not contribute to CCI dynamics. To implement and study CCI dynamics, we employ coherent driving of the NV spin using a combination of time-varying magnetic and strain fields (see Fig. 1). Specifically, we use the well-established method of coherent driving of the |0〉 ↔ |± 1〉 transitions with microwave magnetic fields 20. In addition, we utilize a time-varying strain field to drive the |− 1〉 ↔ |+ 1〉 transition-a recently developed method for efficient, coherent driving of this magnetic dipole-forbidden transition, which is difficult to address otherwise 19,21. Considering the combined action of these three driving fields of amplitudes (Rabi frequencies) $\Omega$ i and frequencies $\omega$ i (Fig. 1a), the dynamics of the NV spin in an appropriate rotating frame (see Supplementary Information) are described by the Hamiltonian = −},

@article{Collin2005,
abstract = {Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects—features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems 1–5 allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements 6 and have already provided infor-mation on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin 7,8 . Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem 9 can be used to deter-mine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers 10 to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin 11 and an RNA three-helix junction 12 . The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure. The Crooks fluctuation theorem 9 (CFT) predicts a symmetry relation in the work fluctuations associated with the forward and reverse changes a system undergoes as it is driven away from thermal equilibrium by the action of an external perturbation. This theorem applies to processes that are microscopically reversible, and its experimental evaluation in small systems is crucial to understand better the foundations of nonequilibrium physics 13 . A consequence of the CFT is Jarzynski's equality 14 , which relates the equilibrium free-energy difference DG between two equilibrium states to an exponential average (denoted by angle brackets) of the work done on the system, W, taken over an infinite number of repeated none-quilibrium experiments, expð2DG=k B TÞ ¼ kexpð2W=k B TÞl. The equality has been developed 6 into a formalism that allows us to use nonequilibrium single-molecule pulling experiments to reconstruct free-energy profiles or potentials of mean force 15 along reaction coordinates. Experimental testing of Jarzynski's equality in single-molecule force experiments 16 used the P5ab RNA hairpin 7,8 , which can be folded and unfolded quasi-reversibly. But for processes that occur far from equilibrium, the applicability of Jarzynski's equality is hampered by large statistical uncertainties that arise from the sensitivity of the exponential average to rare events 17,18 (low values of W). Moreover, although the equality kWl ¼ DG holds for pro-cesses occurring near equilibrium, spatial drift in the experimental system usually makes it difficult in practice to extract unfolding free energies using small loading rates (below a few pN s 21). Drift effects decrease noticeably for larger pulling speeds, making it possible to obtain more reliable experimental data (and also good statistics as a large number of pulls can be executed in a reasonable time), but at the expense of a more irreversible unfolding process. Here we show that significant improvements can be obtained by using the CFT, which provides a more robust and more rapidly converging method to extract equilibrium free energies from non-equilibrium processes. The CFTallows us to quantify the amount of hysteresis observed in the values of the irreversible work done to unfold and refold a macromolecule. Let P U (W) denote the probability distribution of the values of the work performed on the molecule in an infinite number of pulling experiments along the unfolding (U) process, and define P R (W) analogously for the reverse (R) process. For the CFT to be applicable, the unfolding and refolding processes need to be related by time-reversal symmetry, that is, in our experiments, the optical trap used to manipulate the molecule must be moved at the same speeds during unfolding and refolding. Moreover, the molecu-lar transition probed always has to start in an equilibrium state (folded in the unfolding process, and denatured or unfolded in the refolding process) and reach a well-defined final state. The CFT 9 then predicts that: P U ðWÞ P R ð2WÞ ¼ exp W 2 DG k B T},

abstract = {An expression is derived for the equilibrium free energy difference between two configurations of a system, in terms of an ensemble of finite-time measurements of the work performed in parametrically switching from one configuration to the other. Two well-known identities emerge as limiting cases of this result. [S0031-9007(97)02845-7] PACS numbers: 05.70.Ln, 87.10. + e, 82.20.Wt Consider a finite classical system in contact with a heat reservoir. A central concept in thermodynamics is that of the work performed on such a system, when some external parameters of the system are made to change with time. (These parameters may represent, for instance, the strength of an external field, or the volume of space within which the system is confined, or, more abstractly, some particle-particle interactions which are turned on or off during the course of a molecular dynamics simulation.) When the parameters are changed infinitely slowly along some path g from an initial point A to a final point B in parameter space, then the total work W performed on the system is equal to the Helmholtz free energy difference DF between the initial and final configurations [1]: W DF F B 2 F A. [Here F A F B refers to the equilibrium free energy of the system, with the parameters held fixed at A B.] By contrast, when the parameters are switched along g at a finite rate, then W will depend on the microscopic initial conditions of the system and reservoir, and will, on average, exceed DF: W {\$} DF. (1) The overbar denotes an average over an ensemble of measurements of W , where each measurement is made after first allowing the system and reservoir to equilibrate at temperature T , with the parameters fixed at A. (The path g from A to B, and the rate at which the parameters are switched along this path, remain unchanged from one measurement to the next.) Note that the right side of Eq. (1) still refers to the equilibrium free energy difference F B 2 F A. The difference W 2 DF is just the dissipated work, W diss , associated with the increase of entropy during an irreversible process. Equation (1) is an inequality. By contrast, the new result derived in this paper is the following equality: exp2bW exp2bDF , (2a) or, equivalently, DF 2b 21 ln exp2bW , (2b) where b 1k B T. This result, which is independent of both the path g from A to B, and the rate at which the parameters are switched along the path, is surprising: It says that we can extract equilibrium information DF from the ensemble of nonequilibrium (finite-time) measurements described above. Before proceeding with the proof of Eq. (2), we establish notation and then relate Eq. (2) to two well-known equilibrium identities for DF. Since we have fixed our attention on a particular path g in parameter space, it will be convenient to henceforth view the system as parametrized by a single quantity l, which increases from 0 to 1 as we travel from A to B along g. Let z q, p denote a point in the phase space of the system, and let H l z denote the Hamiltonian for the system, parametrized by the value of l. Next, let Z l denote the partition function, let {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} l denote a canonical average, and let F l 2b 21 ln Z l denote the free energy, all with respect to the Hamiltonian H l and the temperature T. We are interested in the following scenario , which we will refer to as "the switching process": The system evolves, in contact with a heat reservoir, as the value of l is switched from 0 to 1, over a total switching time t s. Without loss of generality, assume a constant switching rate, l t 21 s. For a given realization of the switching process, the evolution of the system is described by a (effectively stochastic) trajectory zt, and the work performed on the system is the time integral of l≠H l ≠l along this trajectory: W Z t s 0 dt l ≠H l ≠l zt. (3) Now imagine an ensemble of realizations of the switching process (with g and t s fixed), with initial conditions for the system and reservoir generated from a canonical ensemble at temperature T. Then W may be computed for each trajectory zt in the ensemble, and the overbars appearing in Eqs. (1) and (2) indicate an average over the distribution of values of W thus obtained. In the limiting cases of infinitely slow and infinitely fast switching of the external parameters, we know explicitly the ensemble distribution of values of W , and thus can readily check the validity of our central result. In the slow limit t s ! `, the system is in quasistatic equilibrium with the reservoir throughout the switching process, hence W R 1 0 dl≠H l ≠l l for every trajectory in the 2690 0031-90079778(14)2690(4){\$}10.00},

A tensor network is usually defined for a fixed graph geometry specified by the connection of tensors. In this paper, we generalize the random tensor network approach to allow quantum superposition of different spatial ge-ometries. We setup a framework in which all possible bulk spatial geometries, characterized by weighted adjacient matrices of all possible graphs, are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space and form an overcomplete basis of the boundary. We name such an overcomplete ba-sis as holographic coherent states. A generic boundary state can be expanded in this basis, which describes the state as a superposition of different spatial geometries in the bulk. We discuss how to define distinct classical geometries and small fluctuations around them. We show that small fluctuations around classical geometries define " code subspaces " which are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space isometrically with quantum error correction proper-ties. In addition, we also show that the overlap between different geometries is suppressed exponentially as a function of the geometrical difference between the two geometries. The geometrical difference is measured in an area law fashion, which is a manifestation of the holographic nature of the states considered.},

abstract = {Using ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in optical lattices, we construct a quantum simulator for UðNÞ and SUðNÞ lattice gauge theories with fermionic matter based on quantum link models. These systems share qualitative features with QCD, including chiral symmetry breaking and restoration at nonzero temperature or baryon density. Unlike classical simulations, a quantum simulator does not suffer from sign problems and can address the corresponding chiral dynamics in real time. Introduction.—Non-Abelian gauge fields play a central role in the dynamics of the standard model of particle physics. In particular, the strong SU(3) gauge interactions between quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) give rise to the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry of the light quarks. Heavy-ion collisions pro-duce a high-temperature quark-gluon plasma in which chiral symmetry is restored. The deep interior of neutron stars contains high-density nuclear matter or even quark matter, which may be a baryonic superfluid or a color superconductor [1]. Unfortunately, due to severe sign prob-lems, the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions or the phase structure of dense QCD matter is inaccessible to first principles classical simulation methods. In condensed matter physics strongly coupled gauge theories play a prominent role in strongly correlated systems. In particu-lar, the non-Abelian SU(2) variant of quantum spin liquids has long been debated as a possible connection between the doped Mott insulator and the high-T c superconducting phase in cuprates [2]. The challenge of solving such prob-lems motivates the development of quantum simulators for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Recently, quantum simulators have been constructed for Abelian U(1) gauge theories with [3–5] and without coupling to matter fields [6,7]. Here, we construct a quantum simulator of UðNÞ and SUðNÞ strongly coupled lattice gauge theories in (1 þ 1), (2 þ 1), and ð3 þ 1ÞD using ultracold alkaline-earth (AE) atoms in an optical lattice. On the one hand, our approach is based on quantum link models (QLMs) [8–10], which allow the exact embodiment of non-Abelian gauge interactions in ultracold matter. On the other hand, we utilize fundamental symmetries of matter, such as the SUð2I þ 1Þ invariance of interactions between fermionic AE isotopes such as 87 Sr or 173 Yb [11–20]. While still being far from a quantum simulator for full QCD, simpler model systems share several qualitative features, including confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and its restoration [1]. They provide a unique environment to investigate important dynamical questions which are out of reach for classical simulation. The nonperturbative physics of non-Abelian gauge theo-ries is traditionally addressed in the context of Wilson's lattice gauge theory [21], in which the gluon field is represented by parallel transporter matrices residing on the links connecting neighboring lattice points of a 4D space-time lattice. Since Wilson's classical link variables take values in the continuous gauge group SUðNÞ, the corresponding Hilbert space is infinite dimensional even for a single link. The elements of a quantum link matrix are noncommuting operators, similar to the components of a quantum spin. As a result, QLMs have a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and therefore provide an attractive frame-work for the construction of quantum simulators for dy-namical Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. In the continuum limit of QLMs, which is naturally realized via dimensional reduction, one recovers QCD with chiral quarks as domain wall fermions [22,23]. A pedagogical introduction to QLMs, together with an extensive expla-nation of the corresponding terminology, is contained in the Supplemental Material (SM) [24].

We numerically investigate the ETH by focusing on the large deviation property, which directly evaluates the ratio of athermal energy eigenstates in the energy shell. As a consequence, we have systematically confirmed that the strong ETH is indeed true even for near-integrable systems. Furthermore, we found that the finite-size scaling of the ratio of athermal eigenstates is a double exponential for nonintegrable systems. Our result illuminates the universal behavior of quantum chaos, and suggests that a large deviation analysis would serve as a powerful method to investigate thermalization in the presence of the large finite-size effect.},

We show that the entanglement entropy may be defined in loop quantum gravity, and compute its value for spin network states. The entanglement entropy for an arbitrary region of space is expressed as a sum over punctures where the spin network intersects the region's boundary. Our result agrees asymptotically with results previously obtained from the isolated horizon framework, and we give a justification for this agreement. We conclude by proposing a new method for studying corrections to the area law and its implications for quantum corrections to the gravitational action.},

abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C*- and W*-algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W*-algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

abstract = {A diagonal entropy, which depends only on the diagonal elements of the system's density matrix in the energy representation, has been recently introduced as the proper definition of thermodynamic entropy in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. We study this quantity after an interaction quench in lattice hard-core bosons and spinless fermions, and after a local chemical potential quench in a system of hard-core bosons in a superlattice potential. The former systems have a chaotic regime, where the diagonal entropy becomes equivalent to the equilibrium microcanonical entropy, coinciding with the onset of thermaliza-tion. The latter system is integrable. We show that its diagonal entropy is additive and different from the entropy of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which has been introduced to account for the effects of conserved quantities at integrability. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.040601 PACS numbers: 05.70.Ln, 02.30.Ik, 05.30.{\`{A}}d, 05.45.Mt The notion of entropy was first used by Clausius in the mid-19th century and was soon put in the context of statis-tical mechanics by Boltzmann and Gibbs. Generalized to quantum mechanics by von Neumann in the 1930s and incorporated by probability theory by Shannon in the 1940s, entropy has manifested itself in different forms over the years. Despite the diversity, the consensus is that any physical definition of entropy must conform with the postulates of thermodynamics [1,2]. An appropriate definition of entropy, suitable also for isolated quantum systems out of equilibrium, is fundamen-tal for advances in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and for a better understanding of recent experiments with quasi-isolated quantum many-body systems, such as those realized with ultracold atoms [3]. von Neumann's entropy, defined as S N ¼ {\`{A}}Trð {\^{}} ln {\^{}} Þ, where {\^{}} is the many-body density matrix (the Boltzmann constant here and through-out this Letter is set to unity), complies with the laws of thermodynamics when describing isolated quantum sys-tems in equilibrium and quantum systems interacting with an environment, but it becomes problematic when dealing with closed systems out of equilibrium. Since in an isolated system S N is conserved for any process, this entropy is not consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This motivated the recent introduction of the diagonal (d) entropy [4], which is given by S d ¼ {\`{A}} X},

abstract = {Quantum systems strongly coupled to many-body systems equilibrate to the reduced state of a global thermal state, deviating from the local thermal state of the system as it occurs in the weak-coupling limit. Taking this insight as a starting point, we study the thermodynamics of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths. First, we provide strong-coupling corrections to the second law applicable to general systems in three of its different readings: As a statement of maximal extractable work, on heat dissipation, and bound to the Carnot efficiency. These corrections become relevant for small quantum systems and vanish in first order in the interaction strength. We then move to the question of power of heat engines, obtaining a bound on the power enhancement due to strong coupling. Our results are exemplified on the paradigmatic non-Markovian quantum Brownian motion. Thermodynamics is the fundamental theory concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. In phenomenological thermodynamics, an implicit assumption is that couplings between the working systems and their heat baths are so weak so that effects of the interaction can be neglected. As a consequence, the equilibrium states of the working systems are thermal states, in fact thermal states of local Hamiltonians. For small-scale systems governed by quantum mechanical laws, however, such a weak-coupling limit can be far from being reasonable, as the surface area of such systems is often not much smaller than their volume. An impressive body of literature in a related field, namely, equilibration and thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems [1], strongly suggests that a system coupled strongly to a thermal bath should be described by the local reduced state of the global Gibbs state $\rho$ S ¼ Tr B ½e −$\beta$H =trðe −$\beta$H Þ—and not by a Gibbs state of the local Hamiltonian itself [2–5]. In this work we take this basic but profound insight seriously when studying in detail quantum thermal machines strongly coupled to heat baths. First, we prove exact and general bounds on work extraction from a nonequilibrium system that can be brought in contact with a single heat bath. These results can be captured as universal corrections to the weak coupling limit—showing that strong coupling unavoidably leads to irreversibility and is hence detrimental for work extraction. Similar correc-tions are obtained for heat dissipation and the Carnot efficiency, hence providing strong-coupling corrections to the different formulations of the second law of thermo-dynamics. For thermal machines, we also show that strong interactions lead to power enhancements. There have been recent efforts to describe the thermo-dynamics of quantum systems with strong interactions between system and bath [6–37]. These include consid-erations on heat engines [9–14], equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [15–30,33–37]. The key contribution of the present work, compared with earlier strong-coupling analyses [9–14,21], is to provide bounds on work and efficiency, without having to restrict to any particular model for the systems involved. Our bounds apply to thermodynamic scenarios in which the system equilibrates to the reduced state of a global Gibbs state, and for which the coupling can be switched on and off. More precisely, our results are derived within a framework applicable to general situations; after all, also phenomeno-logical thermodynamics is widely applicable by largely abstracting from the specifics of a given setting. Framework.—We consider a system S, a heat bath B, with internal Hamiltonians H S and H B , respectively. They can interact via a possibly strong interaction V. Thermodynamic protocols then consist on transformations over H S , and equilibration processes induced by V. Specifically, we consider protocols of N steps, and denote by $\rho$ ðiÞ and H ðiÞ the state and Hamiltonian of SB in the ith step, consisting of three elementary operations: (A) Turning on and off interaction.—With this, we model the process of bringing S and B into contact, so that the Hamiltonian takes the form H},

abstract = {Environmental noise and disorder play critical roles in quantum particle and wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems. While separately both effects are known to reduce transport, recent work predicts that in a limited region of parameter space, noise-induced dephasing can counteract localization effects, leading to enhanced quantum transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal of developing large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor: a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 64,400 experiments we observe distinct transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the 'quantum Goldilocks' regime in statically disordered discrete-time systems. Low-loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.},

We study the onset of many-body delocalization through the breakdown of area-law entanglement in a generic many-body eigenstate. By looking for initial signs of an instability of the localized phase, we obtain a value for the critical disorder, which we believe should be a lower bound for the true value, that is higher than current best estimates from finite size studies. This implies that most current methods tend to overestimate the extent of the localized phase due to finite size effects making the localized phase appear stable at small length scales. We also study the mobility edge in these systems as a function of energy density, and we find that our conclusion is the same at all examined energies.},

@article{Fielding2002,
abstract = {We study the nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) in the glass phase of Bouchaud's trap model. We incorporate an arbitrary observable m and obtain its correlation and response functions in closed form. A limiting nonequilibrium FDT plot is approached at long times for most choices of m. In contrast to standard mean field models, however, the shape of the plot depends nontrivially on the observable, and its slope varies continuously even though there is a single scaling of relaxation times with age. Nonequilibrium FDT plots can therefore not be used to define a meaningful effective temperature T eff in this model. Consequences for the wider applicability of an FDT-derived T eff are discussed. Glassy systems relax extremely slowly at low temperatures. They therefore remain far from equilibrium on very long time scales, and exhibit ageing [1]: the time scale of response to an external perturbation increases with the age (time since preparation) t w of the system. Time trans-lational invariance (TTI) and the equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem [2] (FDT) relating correlation and response functions break down. Let Ct, t w mtmt w 2 mt mt w be the autocorrelation function for an observable m, Rt, t w dmtdht w j h0 the linear response of mt to a small impulse in its conjugate field h at time t w , and xt, t w R t t w dt 0 Rt, t 0 the corresponding response to a field step ht hQt 2 t w. In equilibrium, Ct, t w Ct 2 t w by TTI (similarly for R and x), and the FDT reads 2 ≠ ≠tw xt 2 t w Rt, t w 1 T ≠ ≠tw Ct 2 t w , with T the thermodynamic temperature (we set k B 1). A parametric "FDT plot" of x vs C is thus a straight line of slope 21T. In the ageing case, the violation of FDT can be measured by a fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR), Xt, t w , defined through [3,4] 2 ≠ ≠t w xt, t w Rt, t w Xt, t w T ≠ ≠t w Ct, t w. (1) In equilibrium, due to TTI, the derivatives ≠ ≠t w in the FDT can be replaced by 2 ≠ ≠t ; in the nonequilibrium definition (1) this would make less sense since only the t w derivative of xt, t w is directly related to the impulse response Rt, t w. Values of X different from unity mark a violation of FDT and can persist even in the limit of long times, indicating strongly nonequilibrium behavior even though one-time quantities such as entropy and average energy may evolve infinitesimally slowly. Remarkably, the FDR for several mean field models [3,4] assumes a special form at long times: Taking t w ! ` at constant C Ct, t w , Xt, t w ! XC becomes a (nontrivial) function of the single argument C. If the equal-time correlator Ct, t also approaches a constant C 0 for t ! `, it follows that xt, t w R C0 Ct,t w dC XCT. Graphically, this limiting nonequilibrium FDT relation is obtained by plotting x vs C for increasingly large times; from the slope 2XCT of the limit plot, an effective temperature [5] can be defined as T eff C TXC. In such a scenario, where xt, t w and Ct, t w become simple functions of each other, either t w or t can be used as the curve parameter for the FDT plot; the latter is the conventional prescription [3,4]. In general, however, the definition (1) ensures a slope of 2Xt, t w T for a para-metric x-C plot only if t w is used as the parameter, with t being fixed. In the most general ageing scenario, a system displays dynamics on several characteristic time scales, one of which may remain finite as t w ! `, while the others diverge with t w. If, due to their different functional dependence on t w , these time scales become infinitely separated as t w ! `, they form a set of distinct "time sectors"; in mean field, T eff C can then be shown to be constant within each such sector [4]. In the short time sector t 2 t w O1, where Ct, t w decays from C 0 to some plateau value, one generically has quasiequilibrium with T eff T, giving an initial straight line with slope 21T in the FDT plot. The further decay of C (on ageing time scales t 2 t w that grow with t w) gives rise to one of three characteristic shapes: (i) In models which statically show one step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), e.g., the spherical p-spin model [3], there is only one ageing time sector and the FDT plot exhibits a second straight line, with T eff. T. (ii) In models of coarsening and domain growth, e.g., the On model at large n, this second straight line is flat, and hence T eff`[eff`eff`[6]. (iii) In models with an infinite hierarchy of time sectors (and infinite step RSB in the statics, e.g., the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) the FDT plot is instead a continuous curve [4]. T eff has been interpreted as a time scale dependent nonequilibrium temperature and within mean field has been shown to display many of the properties associated with a thermodynamic temperature [5]. For example (within a given time sector), it is the reading which would be shown by a thermometer tuned to respond on that time 050603-1 0031-900702 88(5)050603(4){\$}20.00},

In this work, using large scale exact time evolution we show that for weakly disordered nonintegrable systems information propagates behind a ballistically moving front, and the entanglement entropy growths linearly in time. For stronger disorder the motion of the information front is algebraic and subballistic and is characterized by an exponent, which depends on the strength of the disorder, similarly to the sublinear growth of the entanglement entropy. We show that the dynamical exponent associated with the information front coincides with the exponent of the growth of the entanglement entropy for both weak and strong disorder. We also demonstrate that the temporal dependence of the OTOC is characterized by a fast nonexponential growth, followed by a slow saturation after the passage of the information front. Finally, we discuss the implications of this behavioral change on the growth of the entanglement entropy.},

In the first part I discuss some aspects of Monte Carlo algorithms to generate the raw data. Here special emphasis is placed on non-local cluster update algorithms which proved to be most efficient for this class of models. The second part is de-voted to the data analysis at a continuous phase transition. For the example of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model it is shown how precise estimates of the transition temperature and the critical exponents can be extracted from the raw data.

Here we extend it to arbitrary physical theories, proposing two requirements for the development of a general microcanonical framework. We then formulate three resource theories, corresponding to three different sets of basic operations: (i) random reversible operations, resulting from reversible dynamics with fluctuating parameters, (ii) noisy operations, generated by the interaction with ancillas in the microcanonical state, and (iii) unital operations, defined as the operations that preserve the microcanonical state. We focus our attention on a class of physical theories, called sharp theories with purification, where these three sets of operations exhibit remarkable properties. Firstly, each set is contained into the next. Secondly, the convertibility of states by unital operations is completely characterised by a majorisation criterion. Thirdly, the three sets are equivalent in terms of state convertibility if and only if the dynamics allowed by theory satisfy a suitable condition, which we call unrestricted reversibility. Under this condition, we derive a duality between the resource theories of microcanonical thermodynamics and the resource theory of pure bipartite entanglement.},

Surprisingly, within the accessible time range, the ergodic phase shows sub-diffusive behavior, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient vanishes throughout much of the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit.

@article{Khemani2018,
abstract = {We study the scrambling of local quantum information in chaotic many-body systems in the presence of a locally conserved quantity like charge or energy that moves diffusively. The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling sheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is reversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a slow dissipative process. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is constrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading operator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight of the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is described by diffusive charge spreading; this conserved part also acts as a source that steadily emits a flux of (ii) nonconserved operators. This emission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the dissipative process being the slow conversion of operator weight from local conserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion current. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a butterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and, hence, essentially nonobservable, thereby acting as the "reservoir" that facilitates the dissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a power-law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of the conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival of the ballistic front, but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws, it develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only as a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these results within an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled diffusion equations.},

@article{Polkovnikov2008,
abstract = {It is generally believed that a generic system can be reversibly transformed from one state to another by a sufficiently slow change of parameters. Microscopically, this belief is often justified using connections to the quantum adiabatic theorem stating that there are no transitions between different energy levels if the hamiltonian changes slowly in time. Here, we show that in fact the response to such a slow change can be non-trivial in low-dimensional gapless systems. We identify three generic regimes of the response: analytic, non-analytic and non-adiabatic, which are characterized by a different behaviour of the heating induced in the system with the ramp rate. In the last regime, the limits of the ramp rate going to zero and the system size going to infinity do not commute and the adiabatic process does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. We support our results with numerical and analytical calculations. Adiabatic processes play a major role both in physics and technology. The adiabatic process in thermodynamics is formally defined as a process in which no heat is transferred to the system from the environment and thus the entropy is conserved 1 . Typically, such processes occur at timescales that are fast enough compared with the thermalization times with the environment but slow compared with some intrinsic timescales. In isolated systems with no environment, on the other hand, the definition of adiabaticity on the basis of entropy conservation is not useful, as strictly speaking the entropy of any isolated system is conserved because of Liouville's theorem 1 . Instead, the heating induced in the system can be characterized by the increase of its total energy due to the finite rate of change of parameters of the system (or the ramp rate). The adiabatic process is defined as a process in which the heating vanishes. If the process is cyclic, that is, the final and the initial values of the external parameters coincide, then the absence of heating implies that the energy of the systems does not change. To be specific, assume that some external parameter $\kappa$ is slowly driven from an initial value $\kappa$ A to the final one $\kappa$ B with a ramp rate $\delta$. A simple argument can be made for the generic scaling of the energy added to the system due to finite $\delta$. We assume that on the way the system does not undergo any discontinuous phase transitions (although second-order phase transitions are generally allowed). Then, the energy density (or the energy per unit volume) of the system in the final state, E B , will be a function of this parameter $\delta$ and we can expect that for small enough $\delta$ that we can expand E B},

abstract = {We present numerical results within the one-dimensional disordered Hubbard model for several characteristic indicators of the many-body localization (MBL). Considering traditionally studied charge disorder (i.e., the same disorder strength for both spin orientations) we find that even at strong disorder all signatures consistently show that while charge degree of freedom is nonergodic, the spin is delocalized and ergodic. This indicates the absence of the full MBL in the model that has been simulated in recent cold-atom experiments. Full localization can be restored if spin-dependent disorder is used instead. Introduction. The many-body localization (MBL) is a phe-nomenon whereby an interacting many-body system localizes due to disorder, proposed [1,2] in analogy to the Anderson localization of noninteracting particles [3,4]. The MBL physics has attracted a great deal of attention from theoreticians. Yet, it has so far been predominantly studied within the prototype model, i.e., the one-dimensional (1D) model of interacting spinless fermions with random potentials, equivalent to the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with random local fields. Emerging from these studies are the main hallmarks of the MBL state of the system: (a) the Poisson many-body level statistics [5–9], in contrast to the Wigner-Dyson one for normal ergodic systems; (b) vanishing of dc transport at finite temperatures T {\textgreater} 0, including the T → ∞ limit [10–17]; (c) logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy [18–20], as opposed to linear growth in generic systems; (d) an existence of a set of local integrals of motion [21–24]; and (e) a nonergodic time evolution of (all) correlation functions and of quenched initial states [25–29]. Because of these unique properties, the MBL can be used, e.g., to protect quantum information [30,31]. For more detailed review, see Refs. [32,33]. The experimental evidence for the MBL comes from recent experiments on cold atoms in optical lattices [34–37] and ion traps [38]. In particular, for strong disorders, experiments reveal nonergodic decay of the initial density profile in uncoupled [34] and coupled [36] 1D fermionic chains, as well as the vanishing of dc mobility in a three-dimensional disordered lattice [35]. In contrast to most numerical studies, being based on the spinless fermion models, the cold-atom experiments simulate a disordered Hubbard model. The latter has been much less investigated theoretically [34,39,40], whereby results show that density imbalance might be nonergodic at strong disorder [34,39], in accordance with experiments [34,36]. The essential difference with respect to the interacting spinless model is that the Hubbard model has two local degrees of freedom: charge (density) and spin. The aim of this Rapid Communication is to present numerical evidence that in the case of a (charge) potential disorder and finite repulsion U {\textgreater} 0 (as, e.g., realized in the cold-atom experiments), both degrees behave qualitatively differently. In particular, while for strong disorder the charge exhibits nonergodic behavior (e.g., the charge-density-wave and the local charge correlations fail to reach the thermal equilibrium), the spin imbalance and the local spin correlations show a clear decay. Similarly, we find that dc charge conductivity vanishes with the increasing disorder, whereas spin conductivity remains finite in the dc limit or is at least subdiffusive. The entanglement entropy, which incorporates both degrees, grows as a power law with time. All these findings reveal that even for strong disorders the system does not follow the full MBL scenario, requiring the existence of a full set of local conserved quantities [21,22,32]. The present results point towards a phenomenon of a partial nonergodicity and an effective dynamical charge-spin sep-aration.

abstract = {We provide a study of various quantum phase transitions occurring in the XY Heisenberg chain in a transverse magnetic field using the Meyer-Wallach (MW) measure of (global) entanglement. Such a measure, while being readily evaluated, is a multipartite measure of entanglement as opposed to more commonly used bipartite measures. Consequently, we obtain analytic expression of the measure for finite-size systems and show that it can be used to obtain critical exponents via finite-size scaling with great accuracy for the Ising universality class. We also calculate an analytic expression for the isotropic (XX) model and show that global entanglement can precisely identify the level-crossing points. The critical exponent for the isotropic transition is obtained exactly from an analytic expression for global entanglement in the thermodynamic limit. Next, the general behavior of the measure is calculated in the thermodynamic limit considering the important role of symmetries for this limit. The so-called oscillatory transition in the ferromagnetic regime can only be characterized by the thermodynamic limit where global entanglement is shown to be zero on the transition curve. Finally, the anisotropic transition is explored where it is shown that global entanglement exhibits an interesting behavior in the finite-size limit. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that global entanglement shows a cusp singularity across the Ising and anisotropic transition, while showing non-analytic behavior at the XX multicritical point. It is concluded that global entanglement, despite its relative simplicity, can be used to identify all the rich structure of the ground-state Heisenberg chain.},

A dephased, prethermalized state emerges in a light-cone-like evolution which is connected to the spreading of correlations with a characteristic velocity. In our description we put special emphasis on the influence of the longitudinal trapping potential and the finite size of the system, both of which are highly relevant in experiments. In parti-cular, we quantify their influence on the phase correlation properties and the characteristic velocity with which the prethermalized state is established. Finally, we show that the trapping potential has an important effect on the recurrences of coherence which are expected to appear in a finite size system.},

We find that it decays exponentially when the system and the subsystem sizes are comparable until a saturation limit is reached near half-partitioning, signaling that excited states are maximally entangled.

@article{Giddings2015,
abstract = {If quantum gravity respects the principles of quantum mechanics, suitably generalized, it may be that a more viable approach to the theory is through identifying the relevant quantum structures rather than by quantizing classical spacetime. This viewpoint is supported by difficulties of such quantization, and by the apparent lack of a fundamental role for locality. In finite or discrete quantum systems, important structure is provided by tensor factorizations of the Hilbert space. However, even in local quantum field theory properties of the generic type III von Neumann algebras and of long range gauge fields indicate that factorization of the Hilbert space is problematic. Instead it is better to focus on the structure of the algebra of observables, and in particular on its subalgebras corre-sponding to regions. This paper suggests that study of analogous algebraic structure in gravity gives an important perspective on the nature of the quantum theory. Significant departures from the subalgebra structure of local quantum field theory are found, working in the correspondence limit of long-distances/low-energies. Particularly, there are obstacles to identifying commuting algebras of localized operators. In addition to suggesting impor-tant properties of the algebraic structure, this and related observations pose challenges to proposals of a fundamental role for entanglement.},

@article{Deffner2016,
abstract = {Quantum work is usually determined from two projective measurements of the energy at the beginning and at the end of a thermodynamic process. However, this paradigm cannot be considered thermodynamically consistent as it does not account for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this conceptual inconsistency we introduce a paradigm that relies only on the expected change of the average energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In particular, we completely omit quantum measurements in the definition of quantum work, and hence quantum work is identified as a thermodynamic quantity of only the system. As main results we derive a modified quantum Jarzynski equality and a sharpened maximum work theorem in terms of the information free energy. A comparison of our results with the standard approach allows one to quantify the informational cost of projective measurements. Introduction. In classical mechanics and thermodynamics work is determined by a functional of a force along a trajectory in phase space [1-3]. For quantum systems the situation is much more subtle, since trajectories simply do not exist and a Hermitian work operator cannot be defined [4,5]. Rather, quantum work is commonly determined as the difference between two energies projectively measured at two times: one at the beginning and one at the end of a thermodynamic process [6,7]. Despite the obvious limitations of this notion-no truly open systems can be described since the change of internal energy comprises only work, but no heat-the two-time energy measurement approach has proven to be practical and powerful. For instance, this approach has led to the experimental verification of quantum fluctuation theorems [8,9] and the development of heat engines at the nanoscale [10-13]. Nevertheless, quantum work has remained somewhat elusive with many peculiar features and open questions [14,15]. For instance, it has only recently been pointed out that work can be measured at a single (final) time by means of a generalized measurement [16], that its probability distribution can be interferometrically estimated [17-20], that it reduces to the classical notion of thermodynamic work in high-temperature [21] and semiclassical [22] limits, and that the paradigm of two-time energy measurements is also applicable to open systems as long as the dynamics is unital [23] (see Refs. [24-30]). In the following we will motivate and introduce a definition of quantum work based on a proper characterization of the role of quantum measurements-a feature not present in the semiclassical limit [22]. Imagine the typical situation for which the quantum Jarzynski equality is valid [3]: at t = 0 the system is prepared in a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, $\rho$ 0 ∝ exp (−$\beta$H 0), where H 0 is the initial Hamiltonian and $\beta$ denotes the inverse temperature. Then the density operator $\rho$ 0 is diagonal in energy basis, and the projective measurement of the energy simply determines the thermal occupation probabilities p(n 0) ∝ exp[−$\beta$$\beta$(n 0)]. After the first measurement, the system evolves under a time-dependent Hamiltonian H (t)},

Informally, logical depth is the number of steps in the deductive or causal path connecting a thing with its plausible origin.

abstract = {Since its first discovery in 2004, graphene has been found to host a plethora of unusual electronic transport phenomena, making it a fascinating system for fundamental studies in condensed matter physics as well as offering tremendous opportunities for future electronic and sensing devices. Typically, electronic transport in graphene has been investigated via resistivity measurements; however, these measurements are generally blind to spatial information critical to observing and studying landmark transport phenomena in real space and in realistic imperfect devices. We apply quantum imaging to the problem and demonstrate noninvasive, high-resolution imaging of current flow in monolayer graphene structures. Our method uses an engineered array of near-surface, atomic-sized quantum sensors in diamond to map the vector magnetic field and reconstruct the vector current density over graphene geometries of varying complexity, from monoribbons to junctions, with spatial resolution at the diffraction limit and a projected sensitivity to currents as small as 1 $\mu$A. The measured current maps reveal strong spatial variations corresponding to physical defects at the submicrometer scale. The demonstrated method opens up an important new avenue to investigate fundamental electronic and spin transport in graphene structures and devices and, more generally, in emerging two-dimensional materials and thin-film systems.},

This counterintuitive idea which has its roots in the nonextensive nature of black-hole entropy serves as a guiding principle in the search for the fundamental laws of Planck-scale physics. In this paper we show that a similar phenomenon emerges from the established laws of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of microscopic degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. A rigorous relation between area laws and correlations is established and their explicit behavior is revealed for a large class of quantum many-body states beyond equilibrium systems.},

Its quantum sibling (the QREM), obtained by adding a transverse field to the REM, has similar properties and shows a spin-glass phase for sufficiently small transverse field and temperature. In a recent work, some of us have shown that the QREM further exhibits a many-body localization-delocalization (MBLD) transition when viewed as a closed quantum system, evolving according to the quantum dynamics. This phase encloses the familiar equilibrium spin-glass phase. In this paper, we study in detail the MBLD transition within the forward-scattering approximation and replica techniques. The predictions for the transition line are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization numerics. We also observe that the structure of the eigenstates at the MBLD critical point changes continuously with the energy density, raising the possibility of a family of critical theories for the MBLD transition.},

abstract = {The possibility to achieve entirely frictionless, i.e., superlubric, sliding between solids holds enormous potential for the operation of mechanical devices. At small length scales, where mechanical contacts are well defined, Aubry predicted a transition from a superlubric to a pinned state when the mechanical load is increased. Evidence for this intriguing Aubry transition (AT), which should occur in one dimension (1D) and at zero temperature, was recently obtained in few-atom chains. Here, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of the AT in an extended two-dimensional (2D) system at room temperature using a colloidal monolayer on an optical lattice. Unlike the continuous nature of the AT in 1D, we observe a first-order transition in 2D leading to a coexistence regime of pinned and unpinned areas. Our data demonstrate that the original concept of Aubry not only survives in 2D but is relevant for the design of nanoscopic machines and devices at ambient temperature.},

abstract = {-y 65.40.Gr 02.50.-r 05.40.-a a b s t r a c t The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

abstract = {switching process always begins at specific corners of the samples (Fig. 1). After the nucleation, the magnetic domain with inverted magnetization propagates at an oblique angle with respect to the electrical current before sweeping across the entire disc. The nucleation point alternates between the four quadrants with respect to the direction of the current, controlled by the signs of the current and the external magnetic field. These features can be concisely explained by a simple phenomenological model that takes into account two components of the spin–orbit torque, namely damping-like and field-like torques, along with the external magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction intrinsic to the Co nanostructure. Although the damping-like torque is well-known to be a crucial element during spin–orbit-torque-induced switching, the existence and role of the field-like component had been rather subtle and unclear. Baumgartner et al. have demonstrated that the concerted effect of the field-like spin–orbit torque, the external magnetic field and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction determines the nucleation and the propagation of the inverted domains. Fine-tuning of these three fields by thin-film growth technology will potentially offer a precise control of the switching and its efficiency. The authors also report on more than 10 trillion consecutive switching events in a single sample, with each event completed at a speed of approximately 1 ns. This appears to be sufficiently robust and fast for non-volatile magnetic memory applications, reassuring the position of spin–orbit torques as a leading contender for the future generation of magnetization switching technology. ❐},

abstract = {The many-body localization transition (MBLT) between ergodic and many-body localized phases in disordered interacting systems is a subject of much recent interest. The statistics of eigenenergies is known to be a powerful probe of crossovers between ergodic and integrable systems in simpler examples of quantum chaos. We consider the evolution of the spectral statistics across the MBLT, starting with mapping to a Brownian motion process that analytically relates the spectral properties to the statistics of matrix elements. We demonstrate that the flow from Wigner-Dyson to Poisson statistics is a two-stage process. First, a fractal enhancement of matrix elements upon approaching the MBLT from the delocalized side produces an effective power-law interaction between energy levels, and leads to a plasma model for level statistics. At the second stage, the gas of eigenvalues has local interactions and the level statistics belongs to a semi-Poisson universality class. We verify our findings numerically on the XXZ spin chain. We provide a microscopic understanding of the level statistics across the MBLT and discuss implications for the transition that are strong constraints on possible theories. Introduction. Quantum and statistical mechanics represent two seemingly rather different approaches to the description of complex physical systems. Yet these two viewpoints agree for a wide class of isolated quantum systems, which are said to thermalize [1,2]. Determining the circumstances under which an isolated quantum many-body system becomes its own thermal bath and thermalizes itself, just as Baron Munchausen could pull himself out of a mire by his own hair, perhaps using some kind of fluctuation, is an open question. Phenomena similar to the emergence of thermalization also occur in few-body quantum systems, which frequently show the emergence of so-called quantum chaos [3]. There, upon changing parameters/number of degrees of freedom, the classical system can go from regular to chaotic behavior. On a quantum level this results in changes of the level statistics, which has proven to be a powerful probe of the system properties in the context of quantum chaos. In particular, there exist two standard universal limits: the Poisson statistics (PS) and the Wigner-Dyson level statistics (WDS) [4]. For few-body systems, PS applies to systems that are classically integrable and do not have any level repulsion. WDS stems from random-matrix theory and holds for generic chaotic systems, where energy levels repel each other (i.e., the energy difference between neighboring levels is statistically unlikely to be small compared to the mean level spacing). Integrable (nonchaotic) behavior is abundant in the context of few-body physics. On the other hand, in the many-body world, the only nonthermalizing phase (in the sense of stability to small perturbations) is represented by many-body localized (MBL) systems [5,6]. Recent progress established that thermalization fails in the MBL phase due to the existence of extensively many conserved quantities [7–10]. On the other hand, it is known that one can tune the system through a phase transition into a thermalizing ergodic phase [11–20]. Below, we aim to understand the evolution of the level statistics across the MBL-to-ergodic transition, gaining insights into the breakdown of thermalization. The crossover between PS and WD statistics has been studied extensively in a single-particle physics context: for a quantum kicked rotor [21], integrability breaking perturbations [22,23], and single-particle Anderson localization transitions (ALT) [24–26]. In the many-body problems, a PS to WD crossover is also known to occur upon breaking of (quantum) integrability [27]. In most of the examples, the PS and WDS are the only two stable points. The only known exception is the ALT, where a universal statistics different from PS and WDS emerges at the mobility edge [24]. The spectral statistics in the case of MBL transition was demonstrated to evolve from WDS to PS as one localizes the system [11,28–30], however, not much is known about the intermediate statistics. The common probe used to characterize the level statistics across MBLT is an average ratio of the consecutive energy spacings [11–13,18]. However, this is a single parameter and it does not provide much insight into the intermediate form of the level statistic, nor into the physical details of its crossover. In this paper, we study how the spectral statistics changes across the MBL-delocalization transition. In order to build a microscopic understanding of the level statistics, we generalize Dyson's Brownian motion model [31], previously applied to the ALT [32], to the many-body case. From the mapping to Brownian motion, we obtain nontrivial relations between the fractality [17–20], the spectral statistics, and the properties of matrix elements across the MBLT [20,33]. While many features can be simultaneously explained in this analysis, one surprise is that there appear to be two different regimes of intermediate spectral statistics: in one, the effective interaction between energy levels in the plasma model has a variable power law, while in the other, the effective interaction is short-ranged but over a variable number of levels. Within the picture of Brownian motion [31,32], the level statistics is controlled by the effective interaction between energy levels, see Fig. 1. In particular, deep in the ergodic phase, the WD statistics emerges from the partition function of a one-dimensional Coulomb gas, where particles interact},

abstract = {Thermodynamic depth is an appealing but flawed structural complexity measure. It depends on a set of macroscopic states for a system, but neither its original introduction by Lloyd and Pagels nor any follow-up work has considered how to select these states. Depth, therefore, is at root arbitrary. Computational mechanics, an alternative approach to structural complexity, provides a definition for a system's minimal, necessary causal states and a procedure for finding them. We show that the rate of increase in thermodynamic depth, or dive, is the system's reverse-time Shannon entropy rate, and so depth only measures degrees of macroscopic random-ness, not structure. To fix this, we redefine the depth in terms of the causal state representation—⑀-machines— and show that this representation gives the minimum dive consistent with accurate prediction. Thus, ⑀-machines are optimally shallow. ͓S1063-651X͑99͒12401-2͔ PACS number͑s͒: 05.20.Ϫy, 05.45.Ϫa, 05.70.Ce I.

Each of these processes has its more-or-less well-developed foundations. But where are the principles that define and describe their products? What is structure itself? Does each and every particular combination of forces lead to a different and unique class of natural struc-ture, requiring its own vocabulary and theory? And, how do we detect that some new structure has emerged in the first place? These and related questions about nature's complexity have engaged a large number of researchers for several de-cades now; for a sampling see, e.g., Refs. ͓1–5͔ and refer-ences therein. One focus has been on quantitative measures of the complexity of natural objects and of the processes that bring them into existence—measures that capture properties more interesting than mere randomness and disorder. Exist-ing theory, such as is found in statistical mechanics, provides relatively well-understood measures of disorder in ͑say͒ tem-perature and thermodynamic entropy, and of the flow of en-ergy that can do work in the various free energies. While many applications and problems remain, there is little press-ing need for new conceptual approaches to randomness and energy transduction. However, when it comes to structure something is missing—something else must be invented and then added to physical theory to account for, work with, and quantify different kinds of structure. One class of approaches to natural complexity is based on the theory of sequential discrete computation ͓6,7͔—the theory of how sundry sorts of discrete-state devices process information at varying levels of sophistication. The resulting measures of complexity ultimately express structural proper-ties in terms of universal Turing machines. Unfortunately, almost all interesting mathematical and quantitative ques-tions about these measures of structure inherit the uncomput-ability associated with those all-powerful machines. More fundamentally, though, the idea that everything in the world is really a discrete-state computer strikes one as inadequate; at a minimum nature is parallel, continuous, spatially ex-tended, noisy, and quantum mechanical. Fortunately, in the thermodynamic depth of Lloyd and Pagels ͓8͔ we have a proposal for a noncomputation-theoretic, empirically calculable measure of the complexity of processes. One central motivation for defining the thermo-dynamic depth is that it is small both for regular and for random processes. Thus, one of its appealing features is that depth measures something other than randomness—a prop-erty already well-captured by both Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity ͓9–11͔ and Shannon entropy rate ͓12–15͔. In this paper we introduce the required background for thermodynamic depth ͓8͔ and for an alternative approach to natural complexity, called computational mechanics ͓16,17͔, that extends statistical mechanics to address issues of struc-ture in a direct way. We review the definition of thermody-namic depth and apply it to several simple Markov pro-cesses, revealing several ambiguities. To remove them we redefine the depth in terms of a representation based on causal states, those states through which computational me-chanics views the minimal structure of a system ͓16,17͔. We then prove our main results on the predictive optimality and minimality of the causal state representation. Finally, we draw a number of conclusions about using thermodynamic},

@article{Ross2018,
abstract = {E quilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics provide predictive power that drives much of our fundamental understanding and practical engineering capabilities in chemistry, materials science and biology. However, most natural and technological processes, including photosynthesis, enzyme catalysis, crystal nucleation and material failure, are inherently non-equilibrium. Such processes involve systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium and the subsequent relaxation of those systems towards equilibrium. Achieving a predictive understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena that rivals our understanding of equilibrium phenomena has become a central goal in the study of statistical mechanics. Therefore, recent advances that connect equilibrium state variables, such as free energies, to non-equilibrium experimental processes are of broad fundamental and practical importance. In particular, the use of work-fluctuation relations, such as the Jarzynski equality 1 or the Crooks fluctuation theorem 2 , in conjunction with force spectroscopy 3 has become an important technique for measuring the equilibrium free-energy differences between con-formational states of nucleic acids and proteins in non-equilibrium experiments involving single-molecule pulling 4-9. More recently, similar approaches have been applied to non-equilibrium phenomena in a single-electron system 10 and a single-ion quantum harmonic oscillator 11. The strength of this approach is its generality: the work-fluctuation relations are exact theoretical results 12. Hence, the resulting free-energy determinations do not depend on the details of the system or how far it is driven from equilibrium. However, this approach has inherent limitations that prevent its broader use. In particular, it requires the application and measurement of the external work required to drive the system along a reaction coordinate that corresponds to the important conformational changes of the system. For biomolecular systems in which the relevant reaction coordinate is a position or length, this can be accomplished by attaching the molecule to an atomic force microscope probe 6 or a microscale bead for manipulation by optical tweezers 4,5,7-9. However, such attachments are perturbative and impractical to apply in vivo or in otherwise inaccessible microenvironments 13. Furthermore, for many non-equilibrium processes, such as internal biomolecular rearrangements induced by ligand binding or crystal nucleation and annealing, the important reaction coordinate may not correspond to a position or length, and it may be impossible to drive the system along the reaction coordinate while measuring the applied work. To overcome these limitations and enable the study of a broader range of non-equilibrium systems, new methods are necessary to determine equilibrium free energies from non-equilibrium experiments without the measurement of applied work. Existing methods to determine free energies from single-molecule experimental or simulated data require either a smoothly varying free-energy profile 14-17 or, as with Markov state model (MSM) methods 18 and the clamp-and-release approach proposed by Adib 19,20 , that the system is able to relax to a local equilibrium state at each point along the reaction coordinate 16-18,21-23. Although this is possible with umbrella sampling in simulations, it can impose restrictions on experiments similar to those required for the measurement of applied work. Here, we present relaxation fluctuation spectroscopy (ReFlucS), a method for determining equilibrium free-energy differences, without the application or measurement of work, by analysing thermal fluctuations during the relaxation of a system from a non-equilibrium initial state. In brief, with ReFlucS, we treat the stochastic trajectories of single biomolecules or other fluctuating systems as discrete, reversible Markov processes with coarse graining at different temporal and spatial scales. We then extrapolate to long temporal and small spatial scales to obtain the equilibrium free-energy differences along the experimentally observable reaction coordinate. This extrapolation requires an additional assumption beyond those typically used to derive work-fluctuation relations: that the non-equilibrium dynamics are well-described by Brownian motion near a slow manifold-that is, a relatively low-dimensional surface in configuration space spanned by the most slowly relaxing degrees of Recent advances in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and single-molecule measurements have enabled the determination of equilibrium free energies from non-equilibrium work measurements for fluctuating systems ranging from biological molecules to quantum oscillators. However, for many important non-equilibrium processes, it is difficult or impossible to apply and measure the work required to drive the system through the relevant conformational changes. Here, we show that it is possible, with an appropriate extrapolation to infinite temporal scale and zero spatial scale, to determine equilibrium free energies, without work measurement, by analysing the stochastic trajectories of single biomolecules or other nanoscale, fluctuating systems as they spontaneously relax from a non-equilibrium initial state. We validate the method with simulations and demonstrate its application by determining the free-energy profile for DNA molecules in a structured nanofluidic environment with an experimental protocol that mimics many natural processes with energy injection followed by thermal relaxation.},

abstract = {In these lecture notes, the basic principles of stochastic thermodynamics are developed starting with a closed system in contact with a heat bath. A trajectory undergoes Markovian transitions between observable meso-states that cor-respond to a coarse-grained description of, e.g., a biomolecule or a biochemical network. By separating the closed system into a core system and into reservoirs for ligands and reactants that bind to, and react with the core system, a description as an open system controlled by chemical potentials and possibly an external force is achieved. Entropy production and further thermodynamic quantities defined along a trajectory obey various fluctuation theorems. For describing fluctuations in a non-equilibrium steady state in the long-time limit, the concept of a rate function for large deviations from the mean behaviour is derived from the weight of a trajectory. Universal bounds on this rate func-tion follow which prove and generalize the thermodynamic uncertainty relation that quantifies the inevitable trade-off between cost and precision of any biomolecular process. Specific illustrations are given for molecular motors, Brow-nian clocks and enzymatic networks that show how these tools can be used for thermodynamic inference of hidden properties of a system.},

abstract = {Myoblast fusion is important for skeletal muscle formation. Even though the knowledge of myoblast fusion mechanism has accumulated over the years, the initial signal of fusion is yet to be elucidated. Our study reveals the novel function of a phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor, stabilin-2 (Stab2), in the modulation of myoblast fusion, through the recognition of PS exposed on myoblasts. During differentiation of myoblasts, Stab2 expression is higher than other PS receptors and is controlled by calcineurin/NFAT signaling on myoblasts. The forced expression of Stab2 results in an increase in myoblast fusion; genetic ablation of Stab2 in mice causes a reduction in muscle size, as a result of impaired myoblast fusion. After muscle injury, muscle regeneration is impaired in Stab2- deficient mice, resulting in small myofibers with fewer nuclei, which is due to reduction of fusion rather than defection of myoblast differentiation. The fusion-promoting role of Stab2 is dependent on its PS-binding motif, and the blocking of PS-Stab2 binding impairs cell-cell fusion on myoblasts. Given our previous finding that Stab2 recognizes PS exposed on apoptotic cells for sensing as an "eat-me" signal, we propose that PS-Stab2 binding is required for sensing of a "fuse-me" signal as the initial signal of myoblast fusion.

More specifically, the bound exponentially increases with time but exponentially decreases with the distance between the subsystem and the region where the quench takes place. The fact that the bound is independent of the subsystem volume leads to stronger constraints (than previously known) on the propagation of information throughout many-body systems.

We show that thermodynamic process inequalities, like the second law, are equivalent to the requirement that an effective description for physical dynamics is strongly relaxing. From the perspective of information theory, strongly relaxing dynamics govern the irreversible convergence of a statistical ensemble towards the maximally non-commital probability distribution that is compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium parameters.

Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range inter-actions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies. quantum thermodynamics | quantum information theory | statistical physics | resource theory | free energy T he original formulation of the second law, due to Clausius (1), states that " Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time. " In attempting to apply Clausius's statement of the second law to the microscopic or quantum scale, we immediately run into a problem because it talks about cyclic processes in which there is no other change occurring at the same time, and at this scale it is impossible to design a process in which there is no change, however slight, in our devices and heat engines. Interpreted strictly, the Clausius statement of the second law applies to situations which never occur in nature. The same holds true for other versions of the second law, such as the Kelvin– Planck statement, where one also talks about cyclic processes, in which all other objects beside the system of interest are returned back to their original state. Here, we derive a quantum version of the Clausius statement, by looking at processes where a micro-scopic or quantum system undergoes a transition from one state to another, whereas the environment and working body or heat engine is returned back to their original state. Whereas macro-scopically only a single second law restricts transitions, we find that there is an entire family of more fundamental restrictions at the quantum level. At the macroscopic scale, and for systems with short-range correlations, this entire family of second laws becomes equal to the ordinary second law, but outside of this regime these other second laws impose additional restrictions on thermody-namical transitions. What is more, one needs to be more precise about what one means by a cyclic process. At the macroscopic scale, the fact that a process is only approximately cyclic has generally been assumed to be enough to guarantee the second law. Here, we show that this is not the case in the microscopic regime, and we therefore needs to talk about " how cyclic " a process is when stating the second law. We also derive in this work, a zeroth law of thermodynamics, which is stronger than the ordinary zeroth law. For thermodynamics at the macroscopic scale, a system in state $\rho$ can be transformed into state $\rho$′ provided that the free energy goes down, where the free energy for a state $\rho$ is},

The discussion is focused on application of currently available technologies and analyzes a concrete example of D-Wave machine. A class of simple spin network states which can be implemented on the Chimera graph architecture of the D-Wave quantum processor is introduced. However, extension beyond the currently available quantum processor topologies is required to simulate more sophisticated spin network states, which may inspire development of new generations of adiabatic quantum computers. A possibility of simulating Loop Quantum Gravity is discussed and a method of solving a graph non-changing scalar (Hamiltonian) constraint with the use of adiabatic quantum computations is proposed.},

We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quan-tum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key fea-tures of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimension-ality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

abstract = {It is well known in thermodynamics that the creation of correlations costs work. It seems then a truism that if a thermodynamic transformation A → B is impossible, so will be any transformation that in sending A to B also correlates among them some auxiliary systems C. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case for nonequilibrium thermodynamics of microscopic systems. On the contrary, the creation of correlations greatly extends the set of accessible states, to the point that we can perform on individual systems and in a single shot any transformation that would otherwise be possible only if the number of systems involved was very large. We also show that one only ever needs to create a vanishingly small amount of correlations (as measured by mutual information) among a small number of auxiliary systems (never more than three). The many, severe constraints of microscopic thermodynamics are reduced to the sole requirement that the nonequilibrium free energy decreases in the transformation. This shows that, in principle, reliable extraction of work equal to the free energy of a system can be performed by microscopic engines.},

@article{Mahoney2016,
abstract = {A stochastic process' statistical complexity stands out as a fundamental property: the minimum information required to synchronize one process generator to another. How much information is required, though, when synchronizing over a quantum channel? Recent work demonstrated that representing causal similarity as quantum state-indistinguishability provides a quantum advantage. We generalize this to synchronization and offer a sequence of constructions that exploit extended causal structures, finding substantial increase of the quantum advantage. We demonstrate that maximum compression is determined by the process' cryptic order–a classical, topological property closely allied to Markov order, itself a measure of historical dependence. We introduce an efficient algorithm that computes the quantum advantage and close noting that the advantage comes at a cost–one trades off prediction for generation complexity. Discovering and describing correlation and pattern are critical to progress in the physical sciences. Observing the weather in California last Summer we find a long series of sunny days interrupted only rarely by rain–a pattern now all too familiar to residents. Analogously, a one-dimensional spin system in a magnetic field might have most of its spins " up " with just a few " down " –defects determined by the details of spin coupling and thermal fluctu-ations. Though nominally the same pattern, the domains of these systems span the macroscopic to the micro-scopic, the multi-layer to the pure. Despite the gap, can we meaningfully compare these two patterns? To exist on an equal descriptive footing, they must each be abstracted from their physical embodiment by, for example, expressing their generating mechanisms via minimal probabilistic encodings. Measures of unpredicta-bility, memory, and structure then naturally arise as information-theoretic properties of these encodings. Indeed, the fundamental interpretation of (Shannon) information is as a rate of encoding such sequences. This recasts the informational properties as answers to distinct communication problems. For instance, a process' structure becomes the problem of two observers, Alice and Bob, synchronizing their predictions of the process. However, what if the communication between Alice and Bob is not classical? What if Alice instead sends qubits to Bob–that is, they synchronize over a quantum channel? Does this change the communication require-ments? More generally, does quantum communication enhance our understanding of what " pattern " is in the first place? What if the original process is itself quantum? More practically, is the quantum encoding more compact? A provocative answer to the last question appeared recently 1–3},

abstract = {All existing quantum-gravity proposals are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the gravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the electromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational coupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine structure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, detecting gravitons—the hypothetical quanta of the gravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals—is deemed to be practically impossible. Here we adopt a radically different, quantum-information-theoretic approach to testing quantum gravity. We propose witnessing quantumlike features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses each in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove that any system (e.g., a field) mediating entanglement between two quantum systems must be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on any specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the entanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our argument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is a witness of the field quantization. This experiment does not require any quantum control over gravity. It is also closer to realization than detecting gravitons or detecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations.},

By associating an integral capacity to each edge and a tensor to each vertex in a flow network, we can also interpret it as a tensor network and, more specifically, as a linear map from the input space to the output space. The quantum max-flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this linear map over all choices of tensors. The quantum min-cut is defined to be the minimum product of the capacities of edges over all cuts of the tensor network. We show that unlike the classical case, the quantum max-flow=min-cut conjecture is not true in general. Under certain conditions, e.g., when the capacity on each edge is some power of a fixed integer, the quantum max-flow is proved to equal the quantum min-cut.

@article{Parrondo2015a,
abstract = {By its very nature, the second law of thermodynamics is probabilistic, in that its formulation requires a probabilistic description of the state of a system. This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much eeort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field. S oon after the discovery of the second law of thermodynamics, James Clerk Maxwell illustrated the probabilistic nature of the law with a gedanken experiment, now known as Maxwell's demon 1,2. He argued that if an intelligent being-a demon-had information about the velocities and positions of the particles in a gas, then that demon could transfer the fast, hot particles from a cold reservoir to a hot one, in apparent violation of the second law 1,2. Maxwell's demon revealed the relationship between entropy and information for the first time-demonstrating that, by using information, one can relax the restrictions imposed by the second law on the energy exchanged between a system and its surroundings. But formulations of the second law attributed to Rudolf Clausius, Lord Kelvin and Max Planck 3 make no mention of information. Reconciling these two pictures involves two separate tasks. First, we must refine the second law to incorporate information explicitly. And second, we must clarify the physical nature of information, so that it enters the second law not as an abstraction, but as a physical entity. In this way, information manipulations such as measurement, erasure, copying and feedback can be thought of as physical operations with thermodynamic costs. The first task was partially accomplished by L{\'{e}}o Szil{\'{a}}rd, who devised a stylized version of Maxwell's demon. Szil{\'{a}}rd's demon exploits one bit of information (the outcome of an unbiased yes/no measurement) to implement a cyclic process that extracts kT ln 2 of energy as work from a thermal reservoir at temperature T , where k is Boltzmann's constant 4. This suggests a quantitative relationship between the information used by the demon and the extractable work from a single thermal reservoir. Efforts to address the second task have been many and varied 1,2. L{\'{e}}on Brillouin quantified the cost of measurement in some specific situations; Marian Smoluchowski 5 and Richard Feynman 6 demonstrated that fluctuations prevent apparent second-law violations in autonomous demons; and Rolf Landauer, Charles Bennett and Oliver Penrose 7 proved that measurements can be realized at zero entropy production-albeit at an energetic cost for measurement erasure 1. Bennett subsequently explored several thermodynamic aspects of information processing 8 , including compression, algo-rithmic complexity, logical reversibility and proofreading. Despite this long history of information in thermodynamics, the past decade has seen significant progress due to the application of fluctuation theorems 9,10 and stochastic thermodynamics 11,12. They have provided a general framework for the thermodynamics of information that clarifies and generalizes previous results. In parallel with this theoretical progress, technological advances have led to new experimental techniques for manipulating small fluctuating systems. As a result, the thought experiments of the past, such as Maxwell's demon and Szil{\'{a}}rd's engine, are now being realized in the laboratory 13,14 , allowing the verification of several fundamental predictions regarding information operations 15,16. Our aim in this article is to complement the existing review literature 1,2,11,12,17-19 by presenting an updated overview of the recent developments and experiments, as well as to provide a basic introduction to the main ideas and theoretical tools used to analyse the thermodynamics of information systems. After reviewing the Szil{\'{a}}rd engine, we will discuss how information can be incorporated into a refined statement of the second law, and then continue by analysing physical realizations of memories and information processing. The Szil{\'{a}}rd engine Historically, much of the research on the thermodynamics of information has focused on the cyclic engine introduced by Szil{\'{a}}rd in 1929 (ref. 4). In Szil{\'{a}}rd's original formulation, the engine's working substance is a single-molecule gas in a box of volume V 0 (Fig. 1a), immersed in a thermal reservoir at temperature T , and manipulated by an external agent or demon. The demon initiates a cycle by first rapidly inserting a partition into the middle of the box, splitting it in half. The demon then measures on which side the molecule is trapped and carries out a reversible expansion from volume V 0 /2 to V 0 to extract work W ext = kT ln 2. The cycle is completed by removing the partition. The net effect is the extraction of energy from a single thermal reservoir in a cyclic process, in apparent contradiction to Planck's statement of the second law. Some aspects of the Szil{\'{a}}rd engine seem obscure at first: the molecule does not exert a smoothly varying pressure, but imparts kicks of random intensity, calling into question the applicability of the ideal gas law in the calculation of the work. The role of the measurement is also not clear, as it seems that the pressure itself could reveal the molecule's location. Careful analyses have clarified these issues 1. Moreover, any system that undergoes a phase-space splitting could be used as a 'working substance' 20 .},

abstract = {I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu–Takayanagi formula holds in any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of theorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a " purely boundary " interpre-tation of the formula. I also extend a recent theorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when interpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more physical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I in-clude a self-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of entropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge transformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu–Takayanagi formula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which basically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the formula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quan-tum mechanics. Moreover, they suggest a boundary interpretation of the " bit threads " recently introduced by Freedman and Headrick.},

abstract = {Single particle tracking of mRNA molecules and lipid granules in living cells shows that the time averaged mean squared displacement 2 of individual particles remains a random variable while indicating that the particle motion is subdiffusive. We investigate this type of ergodicity breaking within the continuous time random walk model and show that 2 differs from the corresponding ensemble average. In particular we derive the distribution for the fluctuations of the random variable 2. Similarly we quantify the response to a constant external field, revealing a generalization of the Einstein relation. Consequences for the interpretation of single molecule tracking data are discussed. An ensemble of noninteracting Brownian particles spreads according to Fick's law as a Gaussian packet. The ensemble averaged mean square displacement (MSD) is hx 2 ti  2D 1 t where D 1 is the diffusion constant. By an Einstein relation D 1 is expressed in terms of statistical properties of the microscopic jumps according to D 1  hx 2 i=2hi where hi is the average time between jumps and hx 2 i is the variance of the jump lengths. Instead, one can analyze the time series xt of the particle trajectory and determine the time averaged (TA) MSD 2 ; t  R t{\"{y}} 0 xt 0   {\"{y}} xt 0  2 dt 0 t {\"{y}} ; (1) where is called the lag time. For regular Brownian motion and long measurement time t hi we have 2  2D 1 , i.e., an ergodic behavior such that the diffusion coefficient obtained from an individual trajectory is identical to the diffusion constant found from an ensemble of particles under identical physical conditions. From in vivo single particle tracking the diffusion of lipid granules in yeast cells [1] and of mRNA molecules in E. coli cells [2] two findings were made. (i) The TA MSD is subdiffusive, 2 2 D with 3=4. Usually subdif-fusion is defined by the behavior of an ensemble of particles hx 2 ti  2D t ={\"{y}}1   and 0 {\textless} {\textless} 1. Such anomalous behavior is widespread [3-7], including charge carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors [4], models of gene regulation [8], enzymatic binding in crowded cellular environments [9], and anomalous dynamics of cell migration [10] to name but a few. (ii) The second striking observation [1,2] was that the TA diffusion coefficient D is a random variable different from the diffusion constant of the ensemble D , albeit the measurement time is long (see below) [11]. Namely using Eq. (1) to compute a TA MSD we get a result which varies from one single particle trajectory to another [1,2] (see Fig. 4). This means that ergodicity is broken such that time and ensemble averages of the diffusion process are nonidentical. In this Letter we investigate a widely applicable model for anomalous diffusion: the continuous time random walk (CTRW) [3-7]. In CTRW subdiffusion is scale invariant and hi ! 1 which naturally leads to ergodicity breaking [12,13]. We show that for the subdiffusive CTRW the TA MSD (1) differs from the ensemble average, even in the limit of long averaging times. We obtain the distribution of TA MSDs that completely quantifies the magnitude of the new fluctuations. Then we treat the biased random walk showing that the TA response to an external driving field F also remains random. These new findings lead to a new type of fluctuation-dissipation relation for anomalous ki-netics which depends both on the lag time and the measurement time t. Finally, we discuss the validity of our theory in experimental situations and its generality in other models of anomalous diffusion. The uncoupled CTRW in one dimension is considered [3-6].},

abstract = {We show that a bounded, isolated quantum system of many particles in a specific initial state will ap-proach thermal equilibrium if the energy eigenfunctions which are superposed to form that state obey Berry's conjecture. Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were Gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry s conjecture predicts a Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the par-ticles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will ap-proach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as 0(A/h)t ', where 6 is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averag-ing over an ensemble of initial states is needed.

The challenge is to derive this result from first principles. The biggest problem with a theoretical analysis of this particular experiment is the need to treat the hole in the box in a reasonable way. It is much easier to study the following thought experiment instead. Suppose, after preparing the system in its initial state, we are able to measure the momentum of one atom at a specific (but ar-bitrary) time t. Suppose further that, after having made this measurement, we can empty out the box, and then start it ol' again with the system in exactly the same ini-'Electronic address: mark@tpau. physics. ucsb. edu tial state. We now do this repeatedly, each time measur-ing the momentum of one atom after exactly the same amount of time t has passed. We make a histogram of the results. Let us analyze this experiment, beginning with classi-cal mechanics as the underlying theory.

The phase space of this system is known to be fully chaotic, with no invariant tori for any value of U [1]. Thus the motion in phase space on any constant energy surface is ergodic and mixing. (For a re-view of classical chaos theory, see, e.g. , [2 — 4].) However, this is entirely irrelevant if we always start out with exactly the same initial state, and always make the measurement after exactly the same amount of time has elapsed. The momentum of the measured atom (as-suming that it is always the same atom) is determined ex-actly by the initial conditions, and so will always be the same. To have any hope of obtaining a distribution of momenta, we must average over either the initial condi-tions or the times of measurement or both. If we keep the initial conditions Sxed, ergodicity im-plies that the system wanders all over the constant energy}},

We show that the degree of cortical folding scales uniformly across lissencephalic and gyrencephalic species, across individuals, and within individual cortices as a function of the product of cortical surface area and the square root of cortical thickness. This relation is derived from the minimization of the effective free energy associated with cortical shape according to a simple physical model, based on known mechanisms of axonal elongation. This model also explains the scaling of the folding index of crumpled paper balls. We discuss the implications of this finding for the evolutionary and developmental origin of folding, including the newfound continuum between lissencephaly and gyrencephaly, and for pathologies such as human lissencephaly.},

Given a maximally abelian subalgebra, one can define, on physical grounds, an asso-ciated measure of quantum coherence.

abstract = {This article reviews the physics of high-temperature superconductors from the point of view of the doping of a Mott insulator. The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson's idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d-wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high-Tc cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed. A possible test of the topological structure of the pseudogap phase is described.},

abstract = {We introduce a numerical procedure to evaluate directly the probabilities of large deviations of physical quantities, such as current or density, that are local in time. The large-deviation functions are given in terms of the typical properties of a modified dynamics, and since they no longer involve rare events, can be evaluated efficiently and over a wider ranges of values. We illustrate the method with the current fluctuations of the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process and with the work distribution of a driven Lorentz gas. In the last few years there has been a renewed interest in the theory of large deviations of nonequilibrium systems, with the development of general results concerning the fluctuations of soft modes [1], of nontrivial and rich analytic solutions of explicit models [2-10], and with the discovery of strikingly simple and general nonequilibrium relations [11-19] (the fluctuation theorem, Jarzynski's relation) obeyed by work fluctuations. Perhaps for the first time, we are gathering a few glimpses of truly general features of macroscopic systems well out of equilibrium. The large-deviation function plays an essential role in the investigation of nonequilibrium systems-a role akin to the free energy in equilibrium ones. When available techniques do not allow for an exact evaluation of this function, one turns to simulations: but direct numerical simulation of large deviations is hard, since, by definition, they are rare. In equilibrium, this difficulty is often overcome by introducing biased (non-Boltzmann) sampling [20]. Here we show that a similar strategy can be introduced in systems out of equilibrium, in order to evaluate the large deviations function for quantities that are local in time, although not necessarily in space. We find that, in nonequilibrium, it is necessary not only to bias suitably the dynamics of the system, but also to introduce a process by which images (clones) of the system reproduce or die, a technique inspired by the diffusion Monte Carlo method [21] of quantum mechanics. In the present work, after deriving the general formalism, we show its effectiveness by applying it to two nonequilibrium processes: a stochas-tic one, the totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP), and a deterministic one, a driven Lorentz gas. Our algorithm allows us to compute the probability of obtaining a temporary large-deviation (compared to the typical) value of the current in the first example and of the dissipated work in the second one. We consider the general setup of a system evolving according to Markovian dynamics. Let C; C 0 denote two configurations in the phase space and let U C 0 C be the transition matrix of the discrete (eventually continuous) time dynamics. Denoting by P C t the probability of being in the configuration C at time t, one has P C 0 t  1  X C U C 0 C P C t: (1) In a time interval of length T, a path C 0 ; C 1 ;. .. ; C T in the configuration space, starting from a fixed C 0 , will have the probability Prob C 0 ; C 1 ;. .. ; C T   U C T C T{\"{y}}1 U C 2 C 1 U C 1 C 0 : (2) We shall consider physical quantities Q T that are additive in time, i.e., which can be written as Q T  P T{\"{y}}1 t0 JC t1 ; C t .

abstract = {The maximum speed with which information can propagate in a quan-tum many-body system directly affects how quickly disparate parts of the system can become correlated 1–4 and how difficult the system will be to describe numerically 5 . For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits corre-lations to within a linear effective 'light cone' 6 . However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, because analytic solutions rarely exist and because the best long-range bound 7 is too loose to accurately describe the relevant dynamical time-scales for any known spin model. Here we apply a variable-range Ising spin chain Hamiltonian and a variable-range XY spin chain Hamiltonian to a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system and observe its time evolution. For several different interaction ranges, we determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations, extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. This work opens the possibility for studying a wide range of many-body dynamics in quantum systems that are otherwise intractable. Lieb–Robinson bounds 6 have strongly influenced our understanding of locally interacting, quantum many-body systems. They restrict the many-body dynamics to a well-defined causal region outside of which correlations are exponentially suppressed 8 , analogous to causal light cones that arise in relativistic theories. These bounds have enabled a number of important proofs in condensed-matter physics 5,7,9–11 , and also constrain the timescales on which quantum systems might thermalize 12–14 and the maximum speed that information can be sent through a quantum channel 15 . Recent experi-mental work has observed linear (that is, Lieb–Robinson-like) correlation growth over six sites in a one-dimensional quantum gas 16 . When interactions in a quantum system are long range, the speed with which correlations build up between distant particles is no longer guaranteed to obey the Lieb–Robinson prediction. Indeed, for sufficiently long-range interactions, the notion of locality is expected to break down completely 17 . Inapplicability of the Lieb–Robinson bound means that comparatively little can be predicted about the growth and propagation of correlations in long-range-interacting systems, although there have been several recent theoretical and numerical advances 2,3,7,17–20 . Here we report direct measurements of the shape of the causal region and the speed at which correlations propagate in an Ising spin chain and a newly implemented XY spin chain. The experiment is effectively deco-herence free and serves as an initial probe of the many-body dynamics of isolated quantum systems. Within this broad experimental framework, studies of entanglement growth 21},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {A quantum simulator is a type of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits (or qubits) in a way that can be mapped to certain quantum many-body problems 1,2 . As it becomes possible to exert more control over larger numbers of qubits, such simulators will be able to tackle a wider range of problems, such as materials design and molecular modelling, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems 3 . Here we use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study non-equilibrium dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. We observe a dynamical phase transition after a sudden change of the Hamiltonian, in a regime in which conventional statistical mechanics does not apply 4 . The qubits are represented by the spins of trapped ions, which can be prepared in various initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with an efficiency of nearly 99 per cent. Such high efficiency means that arbitrary many-body correlations between qubits can be measured in a single shot, enabling the dynamical phase transition to be probed directly and revealing computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between qubits. There have been many recent demonstrations of quantum simulators with varying numbers of qubits and degrees of individual qubit control 2 . For instance, small numbers of qubits stored in trapped atomic ions 5,6 and superconducting circuits 7,8 have been used to simulate various magnetic spin or Hubbard models, with preparation and measurement of individual qubit states. Large numbers of atoms have been used to simulate similar models, but with global control and measurements 9 or with correlations that appear over only a few atom sites 10 . Such quantum simulators are excellent platforms for studying quantum systems out of equilibrium 11 . However, an outstanding chal-lenge is to increase the number of qubits while maintaining control and measurement of individual qubits, with the goal of performing simulations or implementing algorithms to tackle problems that cannot be solved efficiently using classical means. Atomic systems are excellent candidates for this challenge, because their qubits can be made to be virtually identical, with flexible and reconfigurable control through external optical fields and high initialization and detection efficiency for individual qubits.

This observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which we discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions, the free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we consider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as free operations in a resource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up correlations with the system at hand.

We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock-BCS analysis of bond order parameters in a single band model on the square lattice with nearest-neighbor exchange and repulsion, while neglecting on-site interactions. The dominant particle-hole instability is found to be an incommensurate, bi-directional, bond density wave with wavevectors along the (1,1) and (1,-1) directions, and an internal d-wave symmetry. The magnitude of the ordering wavevector is close to the separation between points on the Fermi surface which intersect the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary. The temperature dependence of the superconducting and bond order parameters demonstrates their mutual competition. We also obtain the spatial dependence of the two orders in a vortex lattice induced by an applied magnetic field: "halos" of the bond order appear around the cores of the vortices.},

In the random-field Heisenberg model we find a universal power-law growth of the operator EE at weak disorder, a logarithmic growth at strong disorder, and extensive saturation values in both cases. In a Floquet spin model, the saturation value after an initial linear growth is identical to the value of a random unitary operator (the Page value). We understand these properties by mapping the operator EE to a global quench problem evolved with a similar parent Hamiltonian in an enlarged Hilbert space with the same chaotic, MBL, and Floquet properties as the original Hamiltonian. The scaling and saturation properties reflect the spreading of the state EE of the corresponding time evolution. We conclude that the EE of the evolution operator should characterize the propagation of information in these systems.},

@article{Jacobson,
abstract = {The Einstein equation is derived from the proportionality of entropy and the horizon area together with the fundamental relation BQ = T dS. The key idea is to demand that this relation hold for all the local Rindler causal horizons through each spacetime point, with BQ and T interpreted as the energy Aux and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon. This requires that gravitational lensing by matter energy distorts the causal structure of spacetime so that the Einstein equation holds. Viewed in this way, the Einstein equation is an equation of state. PACS numbers: 04.70.Dy, 04.20.Cv, 04.62.+v The four laws of black hole mechanics, which are analogous to those of thermodynamics, were originally derived from the classical Einstein equation [1]. With the discovery of the quantum Hawking radiation [2], it became clear that the analogy is, in fact, an identity. How did classical general relativity know that the horizon area would turn out to be a form of entropy, and that surface gravity is a temperature? In this Letter I will answer that question by turning the logic around and deriving the Einstein equation from the proportionality of entropy and the horizon area together with the fundamental relation BQ = T dS connecting heat Q, entropy S, and temperature T. Viewed in this way, the Einstein equation is an equation of state. It is born in the thermodynamic limit as a relation between thermodynamic variables, and its validity is seen to depend on the existence of local equilibrium conditions. This perspective suggests that it may be no more appropriate to quantize the Einstein equation than it would be to quantize the wave equation for sound in air. The basic idea can be illustrated by thermodynamics of a simple homogeneous system. If one knows the entropy S(E, V) as a function of energy and volume, one can de-duce the equation of state from BQ = T dS. The first law of thermodynamics yields BQ = dE + pdV, while differentiation yields the identity dS = (BS/BE) dE + (BS/BV) dV. One thus infers that T ' = BS/BE and that p = T BS/BV The l. atter equation is the equa-tion of state, and yields useful information if the func-tion 5 is known. For example, for weakly interact-ing molecules at low density, a simple counting argu-ment yields S = ln(No. accessible states) {\~{}} lnV + f(E) for some function f(E). In this case, BS/BV {\~{}} V ', so one infers that p V {\~{}} T, which is the equation of state of an ideal gas. In thermodynamics, heat is energy that fiows between degrees of freedom that are not macroscopically observ-able. In spacetime dynamics, we shall define heat as en-ergy that Aows across a causal horizon. It can be felt via the gravitational field it generates, but its particular form or nature is unobservable from outside the horizon. For the purposes of this definition it is not necessary that the horizon be a black hole event horizon. It can be simply the boundary of the past of any set 6 (for "observer"). This set of horizon is a null hypersurface (not necessarily smooth) and, assuming cosmic censorship, it is composed of generators which are null geodesic segments emanat-ing backwards in time from the set 6. We can consider a kind of local gravitational thermodynamics associated with such causal horizons, where the "system" is the de-grees of freedom beyond the horizon. The outside world is separated from the system not by a diathermic wall, but by a causality barrier. That causal horizons should be associated with entropy is suggested by the observation that they hide information [3]. In fact, the overwhelming majority of the informa-tion that is hidden resides in correlations between vacuum fiuctuations just inside and outside of the horizon [4]. Because of the infinite number of short wavelength field degrees of freedom near the horizon, the associated "en-tanglement entropy" is divergent in continuum quantum field theory. If, on the other hand, there is a fundamen-tal cutoff length l " then the entanglement entropy is finite and proportional to the horizon area in units of l " as long as the radius of curvature of spacetime is much longer than l, . (Subleading dependence on curvature and other fields induces subleading terms in the gravitational field equation.) We shall thus assume for most of this Letter that the entropy is proportional to the horizon area. Note that the area is an extensive quantity for a horizon, as one expects for entropy [5]. As we will see, consistency with thermodynamics requires that l, must be of order the Planck length (10 cm). Even at the horizon of a stellar mass black hole, the radius of curvature is 10 times this cutoff scale. Only near the big bang or a black hole singularity or in the final stages of evaporation of a primordial black hole would such a vast separation of scales fail to exist. Our analysis relies heavily on this circumstance. So far we have argued that energy Aux across a causal horizon is a kind of heat flow, and that entropy of the system beyond is proportional to the area of that horizon. 1260 0031-9007/95/75(7) /1260(4) {\$}06.00 1995 The American Physical Society},

The chosen spin-s defines the area unit or area resolution, which the observer uses to probe the space(time) geometry. For s = 1/2, we are actually dealing with the qubit model, where the horizon is made of a certain number of qubits. In this context, we compute the black hole entropy and show that the factor in front of the logarithmic correction to the entropy formula is independent of the unit s. We also compute the entanglement between parts of the horizon. We show that these correlations between parts of the horizon are directly responsible for the asymptotic logarithmic corrections. This leads us to speculate on a relation between the evaporation process and the entanglement between a pair of qubits and the rest of the horizon. Finally, we introduce a concept of renormalisation of areas in LQG.},

@article{Barkai2001,
abstract = {We consider the theory of time-dependent fluctuations in single molecule spectroscopy. In particular, the relation between stationary spectral diffusion processes and photon counting statistics is investigated. Within linear response theory, a general relation between Mandel's Q parameter and a three time dipole correlation function is obtained. For a prototype spectral diffusion process, an exact solution of Q is found which exhibits rich types of physical behaviors. Experimental advances have made it possible to measure the spectral line of a single molecule (SM) embedded in a condensed phase [1]. The statistical properties of the photons emitted from such a SM illuminates the interplay between dynamical processes in the condensed phase, SM dynamics, and light-matter interaction. An important process responsible for the emission pattern of a SM is spectral diffusion; i.e., perturbers such as two level systems or excitations in the environment of the excited SM lead to random changes in the transition frequency of the SM, and in this way the SM comes in and out of resonance with the exciting laser field [2-8]. The fundamental issue addressed in this work is the photon statistics of a single molecule undergoing a spectral diffusion process. We model these fluctuations in a semiclassical way, using the Bloch equation, in the limit of a weak laser field. The spectral diffusion process is described using a Kubo-Anderson sudden jump approach [9]. The same model leads to a basic understanding of line shape phenomena , i.e., the average number of counts n per measurement time T. Variants of this model have been used in the past to model ensemble measurements, in, e.g., NMR [9] and nonlinear spectroscopy [10]. More recently, this approach was applied to model SM spectroscopy (SMS) in glasses, by Geva and Skinner [11], in [8] to describe static properties of line shapes, and by Plakhotnik [7] to model time-dependent fluctuations of SMS. In this Letter, we present a general formula for Mandel's Q parameter [12], Q n 2 2 n 2 n 2 1 , (1) where n is the random number of counts. We show how Q is related to the underlying stochastic events and how Q yields new information not contained in the average n. For a simple Kubo-Anderson spectral diffusion process, we find an exact solution for Q which gives insight on the characteristics of SMS fluctuations. If Q 0, the photon count is Poissonian while our semiclassical results show a super-Poissonian behavior Q. 0. For short times (e.g., ns), the correlation function between fluorescence pho-tons emitted by a single molecule shows antibunching, a sub-Poissonian nonclassical effect [12-14]. Our approach works well for longer times such that TG ¿ 1, where G is the radiative decay rate of the molecule. The key quantity in the present formulation is a three time correlation function C 3 t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , which is similar to nonlinear response functions investigated in the context of four wave mixing processes [10]. The three time correlation function contains all the microscopic information relevant for the calculation of the line shape fluctuations. It appeared previously in the literature of Plakhotnik [7] in the context of the intensity-time-frequency-correlation technique. In this Letter, important time ordering properties of this function are investigated, and Q is evaluated. The relation between C 3 t 1 , t 2 , t 3 and line shape fluctuations described by Q generalizes the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, that relates the averaged line shape and the one time dipole correlation function. Let us briefly mention some of the limitations of our theory. The experimental measurement time T is bounded due to photobleaching. In some cases, this may limit the collection of a sufficient number of counts to build up enough statistics (see counterexamples [15,16], where photostable SMs were used). Besides spectral diffusion, other physical processes may contribute to SMS fluctuations depending on the SM and its environment. These include triplet state dynamics and SM rotational dynamics. The existence of a SM metastable state (lifetime {\$} ms) leads to a blinking effect, where long periods of brightness with many photon counts are interrupted by periods of darkness of no photon detection ([1] and references therein). Our theory considers the fluctuations in the bright state, which are due to spectral diffusion. Keeping these limitations in mind, we will show below that our theoretical results, in a certain simple limit, describe a SMS experiment [2]. An important issue is the fast and slow modulation limits [9], to be defined later. SMS is often used to detect very slow, time-dependent fluctuations induced by the environment of the single molecule. Fast frequency modulations are much more difficult to detect.

@article{Garcia-Pintos2017,
abstract = {We address the problem of understanding, from first principles, the conditions under which a quantum system equilibrates rapidly with respect to a concrete observable. On the one hand, previously known general upper bounds on the time scales of equilibration were unrealistically long, with times scaling linearly with the dimension of the Hilbert space. These bounds proved to be tight since particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. On the other hand, the computed equilibration time scales for certain classes of typical measurements, or under the evolution of typical Hamiltonians, are unrealistically short. However, most physically relevant situations fall outside these two classes. In this paper, we provide a new upper bound on the equilibration time scales which, under some physically reasonable conditions, give much more realistic results than previously known. In particular, we apply this result to the paradigmatic case of a system interacting with a thermal bath, where we obtain an upper bound for the equilibration time scale independent of the size of the bath. In this way, we find general conditions that single out observables with realistic equilibration times within a physically relevant setup.},

@article{Cramer,
abstract = {A reasonable physical intuition in the study of interacting quantum systems says that, independent of the initial state, the system will tend to equilibrate. In this work we introduce an experimentally accessible setting where relaxation to a steady state is exact, namely, for the Bose-Hubbard model quenched from a Mott quantum phase to the free strong superfluid regime. We rigorously prove that the evolving state lo-cally relaxes to a steady state with maximum entropy constrained by second moments —thus maximizing the entanglement. Remarkably, for this to be true, no time average is necessary. Our argument includes a central limit theorem and exploits the finite speed of information transfer. We also show that for all peri-odic initial configurations (charge density waves) the system relaxes locally, and identify experimentally accessible signatures in optical lattices as well as implications for the foundations of statistical mechanics.},

Using these results we investigate the validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), as well as that of the fast scrambling time bound (STB). We find that the QACM, while possessing a linear spectrum, has eigenstates, which are random and satisfy the assumptions of the ETH. We also find that the thermalization of infalling wave packets in this particular model is exponentially fast, thereby saturating the STB, under the constraint that the finite dimension of the single--particle Hilbert space takes values in the set of Fibonacci integers.},

For two sub-systems separated by a surface the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the surface and depends on the UV cutoff which regulates the short-distance correlations. The geometrical nature of the entanglement entropy calculation is particularly intriguing when applied to black holes when the entangling surface is the black hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of this calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces with conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in the entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the entanglement entropy in 4 and 6 dimensions and their relation to the conformal anomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical singularity method. The relations to other known approaches such as 't Hooft's brick wall model and the Euclidean path integral in the optical metric are discussed in detail. The puzzling behavior of the entanglement entropy due to fields which non-minimally couple to gravity is emphasized. The holographic description of the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon is illustrated on the two- and four-dimensional examples. Finally, I examine the possibility to interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy entirely as the entanglement entropy.},

abstract = {We rephrase the derivation of black hole radiation so as to take into account, at the level of transition amplitudes, the change of the geometry induced by the emission process. This enlarged description reveals that the dynamical variables which govern the emission are the horizon area and its conjugate time variable. Their conjugation is established through the boundary term at the horizon which must be added to the canonical action of general relativity in order to obtain a well defined action principle when the area varies. These coordinates have already been used by Teitelboim and collaborators to compute the partition function of a black hole. We use them to show that the probability to emit a particle is given by e − , where A is the decrease in horizon area induced by the emission. This expression improves Hawking result which is governed by a temperature (given by the surface gravity) in that the specific heat of the black hole is no longer neglected. The present derivation of quantum black hole radiation is based on the same principles which are used to derive the first law of classical black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, it also applies to quantum processes associated with cosmological or acceleration horizons. These two results indicate that not only black holes but all event horizons possess an entropy which governs processes according to quantum statistical thermodynamics.},

These units can be in any nonequilibrium state and interact with the system with an arbitrary strength and duration. We show that this stream constitutes an effective resource of nonequilibrium free energy, and we identify the conditions under which it behaves as a heat, work, or information reservoir. We also show that this setup provides a natural framework to analyze information erasure ("Landauer's principle") and feedback-controlled systems ("Maxwell's demon"). In the limit of a short system-unit interaction time, we further demonstrate that this setup can be used to provide a thermodynamically sound interpretation to many effective master equations. We discuss how nonautonomously driven systems, micromasers, lasing without inversion and the electronic Maxwell demon can be thermodynamically analyzed within our framework. While the present framework accounts for quantum features (e.g., squeezing, entanglement, coherence), we also show that quantum resources do not offer any advantage compared to classical ones in terms of the maximum extractable work.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

abstract = {A thermal equilibrium state of a quantum many-body system can be represented by a typical pure state, which we call a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state. We construct the canonical TPQ state, which corresponds to the canonical ensemble of the conventional statistical mechanics. It is related to the microcanonical TPQ state, which corresponds to the microcanonical ensemble, by simple analytic transformations. Both TPQ states give identical thermodynamic results, if both ensembles do, in the thermodynamic limit. The TPQ states corresponding to other ensembles can also be constructed. We have thus established the TPQ formulation of statistical mechanics, according to which all quantities of statistical-mechanical interest are obtained from a single realization of any TPQ state. We also show that it has great advantages in practical applications. As an illustration, we study the spin-1=2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Statistical mechanics is conventionally described by the ensemble formulation, in which an equilibrium state is rep-resented by a mixed quantum state. Although its basic prin-ciples are introduced in the microcanonical ensemble, one can derive other ensembles, such as the canonical ensemble. This makes statistical mechanics powerful and practical because for most applications the (grand) canonical ensemble is more convenient than the microcanonical one. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that almost all pure quantum states in a specified energy shell represent an equilibrium state [1–5]. Generalizing this fact, we have defined a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state as a pure quantum state that represents an equilibrium state and proposed a new formulation of statistical mechanics based on the TPQ state [6]. Since the TPQ state proposed there corresponds to the microcanonical ensemble, we here call it the microcanonical TPQ state. Then, natural questions arise: Are there TPQ states that correspond to other ensem-bles? How are they related to each other? In this Letter, we construct a new type of TPQ state, the canonical TPQ state, which corresponds to the canonical ensemble. We show that it is related to the microcanonical TPQ state by simple analytic transformations. The TPQ states corresponding to other ensembles, such as the grand canonical ensemble, can also be constructed in a similar manner. These results establish the new formulation of statistical mechanics, which enables one to obtain all quantities of statistical-mechanical interest from a single realization of a TPQ state. This formulation is not only interesting as fundamental physics but also advantageous in practical applications because one needs only to construct a single pure state by just multiplying the Hamiltonian matrix to a random vector. The canonical TPQ state is particularly advantageous at low but finite temperature, whereas the microcanonical one is suitable for first-order phase transitions. As an illustration, we study the spin-1=2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet (KHA) using the canonical TPQ state. Setup and definition.—We consider a quantum system composed of N sites or particles. By using an effective model in the energy scale of interest [7], we describe the system with a Hilbert space H N of dimension N , where ¼ {\^{A}}ð1Þ [8] (¼ 2 for spin-1=2 systems). To take the},

abstract = {Introduction. There is no current consensus as to the most effective nonsurgical therapy for Peyronie's disease (PD). Aim. This study aims to assess the benefit of penile traction therapy (PTT) when added to intralesional verapamil injections (IVIs) combined with oral L-arginine 1 g b.i.d. and pentoxifylline 400 mg t.i.d. in men with PD. Methods. Seventy-four men with PD completed 12 IVIs. Patients electing to add PTT were advised to wear the device for 2–8 hours daily and no longer than 2 hours per session. Subjective responses were measured using patient questionnaires. Stretched penile length (SPL) and erect penile curvature (EPC) using penile duplex ultrasound were measured. Response to therapy was defined as at least a 10-degree reduction in EPC. Main Outcome Measures. Change in SPL (cm) and change in EPC (degrees). Results. Thirty-five patients in group I vs. 39 patients in the PTT group II completed the protocol. Fifty-four percent of men in group II responded to therapy vs. 46{\%} in group I (P = 0.75). Responders in group II had a mean EPC improvement of 26.9 degrees vs. 20.9 degrees in group I (P = 0.22). Mean PTT use was 3.3 hours per day, and men with {\textgreater}3 hours per day use gained 0.6 cm in SPL vs. 0.07 cm using less than or equal to 3 hours per day (P = 0.09), while men in group I lost 0.74 cm of SPL on average. Multivariate analysis revealed that duration of PTT use significantly predicts length gain (0.38 cm gain for every additional hour per day of PTT use, P = 0.007). Conclusions. There was a trend toward measured curvature improvement and a significant gain in SPL in men using the combination therapy protocol. Length improvement is related to duration of use of the traction device. Abern MR, Larsen S, and Levine LA.

abstract = {We analyze the nature of the statistics of the work done on or by a quantum many-body system brought out of equilibrium. We show that, for the sudden quench and for an initial state that commutes with the initial Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve the whole nonequilibrium thermodynamics via single projective measurements of observables. We highlight, in a physically clear way, the qualitative implications for the statistics of work coming from considering processes described by operators that either commute or do not commute with the unperturbed Hamiltonian of a given system. We consider a quantum many-body system and derive an expression that allows us to give a physical interpretation, for a thermal initial state, to all of the cumulants of the work in the case of quenched operators commuting with the unperturbed Hamiltonian. In the commuting case, the observables that we need to measure have an intuitive physical meaning. Conversely, in the noncommuting case, we show that, although it is possible to operate fully within the single-measurement framework irrespectively of the size of the quench, some difficulties are faced in providing a clear-cut physical interpretation to the cumulants. This circumstance makes the study of the physics of the system nontrivial and highlights the nonintuitive phenomenology of the emergence of thermodynamics from the fully quantum microscopic description. We illustrate our ideas with the example of the Ising model in a transverse field showing the interesting behavior of the high-order statistical moments of the work distribution for a generic thermal state and linking them to the critical nature of the model itself.},

Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the distribution of these random work costs to the corresponding distribution for the reverse process. By an analysis that explicitly incorporates the energy reservoir that donates the energy and the control system that implements the dynamic, we obtain a quantum generalization of Crooks theorem that not only includes the energy changes in the reservoir but also the full description of its evolution, including coherences. Moreover, this approach opens up the possibility for generalizations of the concept of fluctuation relations. Here, we introduce " conditional " fluctuation relations that are applicable to nonequilibrium systems, as well as approximate fluctuation relations that allow for the analysis of autonomous evolution generated by global time-independent Hamiltonians.

The connection between this problem and the problem of physical time in (compact space) general relativity is emphasized. The idea that a preferred physical time variable is singled out by the statistical properties of the state is proposed. A scheme for a generally covariant statistical thermodynamics is put forward, by extending the Gibbs formalism to the presymplectic, or constrained, dynamical systems. This scheme is based on three equations. The first characterizes any statistical state; the second is the definition of a vector flow in terms of the statistical state; the third is an intrinsic definition of equilibrium. The vector flow of an equilibrium state is denoted thermodynamical time, and the suggestion is made that thermodynamical time is the internal time that carries all the 'common sense' characterizations of the notion of time. Finally, it is suggested that the issue of the second law of the thermodynamics could be reconsidered within this generally covariant framework.},

abstract = {The origin of the exceptionally strong superconductivity of cuprates remains a subject of debate after more than two decades of investigation. Here we follow a new lead: The onset temperature for superconductivity scales with the strength of the anomalous normal-state scattering that makes the resistivity linear in tempera-ture. The same correlation between linear resistivity and T c is found in organic superconductors, for which pairing is known to come from fluctuations of a nearby antiferromagnetic phase, and in pnictide superconductors, for which an antiferromagnetic scenario is also likely. In the cuprates, the question is whether the pseudogap phase plays the corresponding role, with its fluctuations responsi-ble for pairing and scattering. We review recent studies that shed light on this phase—its boundary, its quantum critical point, and its broken symmetries. The emerging picture is that of a phase with spin-density-wave order and fluctuations, in broad analogy with organic, pnictide, and heavy-fermion superconductors.},

abstract = {In relativistic quantum field theory, information propagation is bounded by the speed of light. No such limit exists in the non-relativistic case, although in real physical systems, short-range interactions may be expected to restrict the propagation of information to finite velocities. The question of how fast correla-tions can spread in quantum many-body systems has been long studied 1 . The existence of a maximal velocity, known as the Lieb– Robinson bound, has been shown theoretically to exist in several interacting many-body systems (for example, spins on a lattice 2–5)— such systems can be regarded as exhibiting an effective light cone that bounds the propagation speed of correlations. The existence of such a 'speed of light' has profound implications for condensed matter physics and quantum information, but has not been observed experimentally. Here we report the time-resolved detection of propagating correlations in an interacting quantum many-body system. By quenching a one-dimensional quantum gas in an optical lattice, we reveal how quasiparticle pairs transport correlations with a finite velocity across the system, resulting in an effective light cone for the quantum dynamics. Our results open perspectives for understanding the relaxation of closed quantum systems far from equilibrium 6},

abstract = {We consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a heat reservoir and driven by arbitrary time-dependent parameters. We derive exact microscopic expressions for the nonequilibrium entropy production and entropy production rate, valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium. By using the two-point energy measurement statistics for system and reservoir, we further obtain a quantum generalization of the integrated fluctuation theorem put forward by Seifert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 040602 (2005)]. Nonequilibrium phenomena are ubiquitous in nature. Yet, a general framework allowing their description far from equilibrium is lacking [1]. A defining feature of out-of-equilibrium systems is that they dissipate energy in the form of heat, leading to an irreversible increase of their entropy. The nonequilibrium entropy production AE and its time derivative, the entropy production rate ¼ @ t AE, are therefore two fundamental concepts of nonequi-librium thermodynamics [1]. Traditionally, the entropy production is used to evaluate the performance of thermo-dynamic devices: the maximal useful work, the availability (or exergy), that can be extracted from a given system, is reduced by the presence of irreversibilities, such as friction or nonstatic transformations. This loss of availability is directly related to the mean entropy production hAEi [2]. On the other hand, the entropy production rate is the generating function of the nonequilibrium fluxes. Consider a system driven away from equilibrium by some thermodynamic forces X i , for example, an electric field or a temperature difference. These forces will cause unknown nonequilibrium fluxes J i , for instance an electric current or a heat flow, that are given by the derivative of the entropy production rate with respect to the applied force, J i ¼ @=@X i [1]. More recently, the entropy production has been instrumental in the analysis of nonequilibrium effects in many different branches of physics [3-5], including the study of quantum impurity models [6] and of quenched quantum many-body systems [7]. The explicit expression of the mean quantum entropy production hAEi is in general unknown, however. A remarkable property of the entropy production is that it satisfies a fluctuation theorem of the form hexpð{\`{A}}AEÞi ¼ 1, which holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium [8,9]. A unified version of classical fluctuation theorems, valid for nonequilibrium initial conditions and arbitrary driving, has lately been obtained by Seifert for the total entropy change occurring in system and reservoir [10]. In this Letter, we provide generic microscopic expressions for the entropy production, and the entropy production rate, for open quantum systems that are weakly coupled to a heat reservoir and driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium by external parameters. The time evolution and the thermodynamic properties of weakly damped quantum systems are usually described by Markovian master equations of the Lindblad type [11-13]. With their help, microscopic expressions for the entropy production rate in terms of the reduced density operator of the system have been obtained for relaxation [14], transport [15], and slowly driven quantum processes [16]. Moreover, a fluctuation theorem for the entropy produced along quantum trajectories has been derived in Refs. [17-19]. However, Markovian master equations are limited to slow driving, that is near equilibrium processes, as their derivation is based on the assumption of time-independent Hamiltonians [20]. A formulation of completely positive maps for fast driven quantum systems, that is far from equilibrium transformations, for which the Markovian approximation is likely to break down, appears difficult [21,22]. In the following, we employ a thermodynamic approach to derive the exact mean nonequilibrium quantum entropy production and mean quantum entropy production rate without relying on master equations or on quantum trajectories. The obtained expressions are therefore valid for driving processes that operate arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In addition, starting from the two-point energy measurement statistics for system and reservoir, we derive a quantum extension of Seifert's fluctuation theorem [10]. Our general formalism allows us to recover and extend a number of previously known results in a unified manner. Nonequilibrium quantum entropy production.-We consider a quantum system whose Hamiltonian H t is driven by an arbitrary time-dependent external parameter during a finite time interval. The system is assumed to be weakly coupled to an infinitely large thermal reservoir with which it can exchange energy in the form of heat [23]. We focus, for the time being, on the situation where the system is initially and finally in states that are not in equilibrium with the reservoir, but nonetheless are local equilibrium states, so that the thermodynamic variables of the system-in particular its entropy-are well defined. We emphasize that the quantum system need not remain close to PRL},

Using a circuit design based on a nanoscale spin valve, we coherently hybridize the individual spin and charge states of a double quantum dot while preserving spin coherence. This scheme allows us to achieve spin-photon coupling up to the megahertz range at the single-spin level. The cooperativity is found to reach 2.3, and the spin coherence time is about 60 nanoseconds. We thereby demonstrate a mesoscopic device suitable for nondestructive spin readout and distant spin coupling.},

abstract = {Quantum systems strongly coupled to many-body systems equilibrate to the reduced state of a global thermal state, deviating from the local thermal state of the system as it occurs in the weak-coupling limit. Taking this insight as a starting point, we study the thermodynamics of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths. First, we provide strong-coupling corrections to the second law applicable to general systems in three of its different readings: As a statement of maximal extractable work, on heat dissipation, and bound to the Carnot efficiency. These corrections become relevant for small quantum systems and vanish in first order in the interaction strength. We then move to the question of power of heat engines, obtaining a bound on the power enhancement due to strong coupling. Our results are exemplified on the paradigmatic non-Markovian quantum Brownian motion. Thermodynamics is the fundamental theory concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. In phenomenological thermodynamics, an implicit assumption is that couplings between the working systems and their heat baths are so weak so that effects of the interaction can be neglected. As a consequence, the equilibrium states of the working systems are thermal states, in fact thermal states of local Hamiltonians. For small-scale systems governed by quantum mechanical laws, however, such a weak-coupling limit can be far from being reasonable, as the surface area of such systems is often not much smaller than their volume. An impressive body of literature in a related field, namely, equilibration and thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems [1], strongly suggests that a system coupled strongly to a thermal bath should be described by the local reduced state of the global Gibbs state $\rho$ S ¼ Tr B ½e −$\beta$H =trðe −$\beta$H Þ-and not by a Gibbs state of the local Hamiltonian itself [2-5]. In this work we take this basic but profound insight seriously when studying in detail quantum thermal machines strongly coupled to heat baths. First, we prove exact and general bounds on work extraction from a nonequilibrium system that can be brought in contact with a single heat bath. These results can be captured as universal corrections to the weak coupling limit-showing that strong coupling unavoidably leads to irreversibility and is hence detrimental for work extraction. Similar corrections are obtained for heat dissipation and the Carnot efficiency, hence providing strong-coupling corrections to the different formulations of the second law of thermo-dynamics. For thermal machines, we also show that strong interactions lead to power enhancements. There have been recent efforts to describe the thermo-dynamics of quantum systems with strong interactions between system and bath [6-37]. These include considerations on heat engines [9-14], equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics [15-30,33-37]. The key contribution of the present work, compared with earlier strong-coupling analyses [9-14,21], is to provide bounds on work and efficiency, without having to restrict to any particular model for the systems involved. Our bounds apply to thermodynamic scenarios in which the system equilibrates to the reduced state of a global Gibbs state, and for which the coupling can be switched on and off. More precisely, our results are derived within a framework applicable to general situations; after all, also phenomeno-logical thermodynamics is widely applicable by largely abstracting from the specifics of a given setting. Framework.-We consider a system S, a heat bath B, with internal Hamiltonians H S and H B , respectively. They can interact via a possibly strong interaction V. Thermodynamic protocols then consist on transformations over H S , and equilibration processes induced by V. Specifically, we consider protocols of N steps, and denote by $\rho$ ðiÞ and H ðiÞ the state and Hamiltonian of SB in the ith step, consisting of three elementary operations: (A) Turning on and off interaction.-With this, we model the process of bringing S and B into contact, so that the Hamiltonian takes the form H ðiÞ ¼ H ðiÞ S þ H B þ V. Similarly, V can be turned off at any step of the process. Treating such processes as quenches, the average work gain when placing or removing V is W ðiÞ on ¼ Trð$\rho$ ðiÞ VÞ ¼ −W ðiÞ off : ð1Þ (B) A quench on S.-A fast transformation of H S is implemented, so that H ðiÞ ¼ H ðiÞ S þ H B þ V is changed to PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 120, 120602 (2018) 0031-9007=18=120(12)=120602(6) 120602-1},

abstract = {Complex physical dynamics can often be modeled as a Markov jump process between mesoscopic configurations. When jumps between mesoscopic states are mediated by thermodynamic reservoirs, the time-irreversibility of the jump process is a measure of the physical dissipation. We rederive a recently introduced inequality relating the dissipation rate to current fluctuations in jump processes. We then adapt these results to diffusion processes via a limiting procedure, reaffirming that diffusions saturate the inequality. Finally, we study the impact of spatial coarse-graining in a two-dimensional model with driven diffusion. By observing fluctuations in coarse-grained currents, it is possible to infer a lower bound on the total dissipation rate, including the dissipation associated with hidden dynamics. The tightness of this bound depends on how well the spatial coarse-graining detects dynamical events that are driven by large thermodynamic forces. 3 This article belongs to the special issue: Emerging Talents, which features invited work from the best early-career researchers working within the scope of J.

We compare and contrast the dynamical transport properties across the many-body localization (MBL) transition in quasiperiodic and random models.

We show that the low-energy transport dynamics is markedly distinct in both the thermal and MBL phases in quasiperiodic and random models and find that the diffusive and MBL regimes of the quasiperiodic model are more robust than those in the random system. Using the distribution of the dc conductivity, we quantify the contribution of sample-to-sample and state-to-state fluctuations of $\sigma$ ($\omega$) across the MBL transition. We find that the activated dynamical scaling ansatz works poorly in the quasiperiodic model but holds in the random model with an estimated activation exponent $\psi$ ≈ 0.9. We argue that near the MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems, critical eigenstates give rise to a subdiffusive crossover regime on finite-size systems.},

In the maximally entangled gauge-invariant case, the entanglement monotone is proportional to a power of the area of the surface dual to the link thus supporting a connection between entanglement and the (simplicial) geometric properties of spin network states. We extend then such analysis to the study of non-local correlations between two non-adjacent regions of a generic spin network. In the end, our analysis shows that the same spin network graph can be understood as an information graph whose connectivity encodes, both at the local and non-local level, the quantum correlations among its parts. This gives a further connection between entanglement and geometry.},

E 50, 1645 ͑1994͔͒ implies that the Kawasaki function ͗exp(Ϫ⍀ t)͘ is unity for all time t. We confirm this relationship using experimental data obtained using optical tweezers, and show that the Kawasaki function is a valuable diagnostic tool. In 1993 the first quantitative description of entropy pro-duction in finite systems was given by the Fluctuation Theo-rem ͑FT͒ of Evans et al. 1 In the decade since, a great deal of research has been carried out on various forms of the FT, 2–7 including two recent experiments. 8,9 Combined, this research demonstrates that the FT is correct and that it places thermo-dynamic constraints on the operation of nanomachines. In its most general form, the theorem provides an analytic expres-sion for the probability that the dissipative flux flows in the direction opposite to that required by the second law of ther-modynamics. The argument of the theorem is the dissipation function ⍀ t . In the case of thermostated dissipative systems, the ensemble average of the dissipation function ͗⍀ t ͘ is the time integral of the irreversible entropy production rate. The FT relates the probability of observing a process of duration t with ⍀ t ϭAϮdA, P(⍀ t ϭA), to that of a process with the same magnitude of dissipation change, but of opposite sign: P͑⍀ t ϭϪA ͒ P͑⍀ t ϭA ͒ ϭexp͑ϪA ͒. ͑1͒ The theory and experiments also compare an integrated form of the FT, the IFT. It predicts the frequency of ''negative-⍀ t '' trajectories ͑similar to ''entropy-consuming'' trajectories 8 ͒ ⍀ t Ͻ0 to ''positive-⍀ t '' trajectories ͑similar to ''entropy-producing trajectories''͒ ⍀ t Ͼ0: P͑⍀ t Ͻ0 ͒ P͑⍀ t Ͼ0 ͒ ϭ͗exp͑Ϫ⍀ t ͒͘ ⍀ t Ͼ0 , ͑2͒ where the brackets on the right-hand side ͑RHS͒ denote an average accumulated only over positive-⍀ t trajectories. Since the original FT publication, several other versions of the theorem have been shown to exist for various systems, 10 and are tabulated in a recent review. 11 While much research has focused on the FT, the Kawasaki function 12 ͗exp(Ϫ⍀ t)͘, which is intimately related to the FT, has rarely been discussed. A proof by Evans and Searles 13 shows that the Kawasaki function obeys the iden-tity ͗exp͑Ϫ⍀ t ͒͘ϵ1. ͑3͒ We call this equation the Kawasaki Identity ͑KI͒. In this paper we show that the KI is a direct result of the FT and that the Kawasaki function is a useful diagnostic tool. The devia-tion of the Kawasaki function from unity provides an imme-diate indicator to the effectiveness of the phase-space sam-pling and to the quality of the results. First we show that the KI follows directly from the FT, Eq. ͑1͒, and the definition of an ensemble average. The en-semble average of the Kawasaki function can be written as ͗exp͑Ϫ⍀ t ͒͘ϭ ͵},

abstract = {Spin resonance of individual spin centers allows applications ranging from quantum information technology to atomic-scale magnetometry. To protect the quantum properties of a spin, control over its local environment, including energy relaxation and decoherence processes, is crucial. However, in most existing architectures, the environment remains fixed by the crystal structure and electrical contacts. Recently, spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in combination with electron spin resonance (ESR), allowed the study of single adatoms and inter-atomic coupling with an unprecedented combination of spatial and energy resolution. We elucidate and control the interplay of an Fe single spin with its atomic-scale environment by precisely tuning the phase coherence time T 2 using the STM tip as a variable electrode. We find that the decoherence rate is the sum of two main contributions. The first scales linearly with tunnel current and shows that, on average, every tunneling electron causes one dephasing event. The second, effective even without current, arises from thermally activated spin-flip processes of tip spins. Understanding these interactions allows us to maximize T 2 and improve the energy resolution. It also allows us to maximize the amplitude of the ESR signal, which supports measurements even at elevated temperatures as high as 4 K. Thus, ESR-STM allows control of quantum coherence in individual, electrically accessible spins.},

abstract = {Many-body localization occurs in isolated quantum systems when Anderson localization persists in the presence of finite interactions. Despite strong evidence for the existence of a many-body localization transition, a reliable extraction of the critical disorder strength is difficult due to a large drift with system size in the studied quantities. In this Letter, we explore two entanglement properties that are promising for the study of the many-body localization transition: the variance of the half-chain entanglement entropy of exact eigenstates and the long time change in entanglement after a local quench from an exact eigenstate. We investigate these quantities in a disordered quantum Ising chain and use them to estimate the critical disorder strength and its energy dependence. In addition, we analyze a spin-glass transition at large disorder strength and provide evidence for it being a separate transition.

abstract = {Tensor networks implementing quantum error correcting codes have recently been used to construct toy models of holographic duality explicitly realizing some of the more puzzling features of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These models reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for boundary intervals, and allow bulk operators to be mapped to the boundary in a redundant fashion. These exactly solvable, explicit models have provided valuable insight but nonetheless suffer from many deficiencies, some of which we attempt to address in this article. We propose a new class of tensor network models that subsume the earlier advances and, in addition, incorporate additional features of holographic duality, including: (1) a holographic interpretation of all boundary states, not just those in a " code " subspace, (2) a set of bulk states playing the role of " classical geometries " which reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for boundary intervals, (3) a bulk gauge symmetry analogous to diffeomorphism invariance in gravitational theories, (4) emergent bulk locality for sufficiently sparse excitations, and (5) the ability to describe geometry at sub-AdS resolutions or even flat space.},

Firstly in the limit n → ∞ we show that any translationally invariant Hamiltonian of a chain of n qubits has an eigenbasis such that almost all eigenstates have maximal entanglement between fixed-size sub-blocks of qubits and the rest of the system; in this sense these eigenstates are like those of completely general Hamiltonians (i.e., Hamiltonians with interactions of all orders between arbitrary groups of qubits). Secondly, in the limit n → ∞ we show that any nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian of a chain of n qubits has a Gaussian density of states; thus as far as the eigenvalues are concerned the system is like a non-interacting one. The comparison applies to chains of qubits with translationally invariant nearest-neighbour interactions, but we show that it is extendible to much more general systems (both in terms of the local dimension and the geometry of interaction). Numerical evidence is also presented that suggests that the translational invariance condition may be dropped in the case of nearest-neighbour chains.},

abstract = {We consider low-temperature behavior of weakly interacting electrons in disordered conductors in the regime when all single-particle eigenstates are localized by the quenched disorder. We prove that in the absence of coupling of the electrons to any external bath dc electrical conductivity exactly vanishes as long as the temperature T does not exceed some finite value T c . At the same time, it can be also proven that at high enough T the conductivity is finite. These two statements imply that the system undergoes a finite temperature metal-to-insulator transition, which can be viewed as Ander-son-like localization of many-body wave functions in the Fock space. Metallic and insulating states are not different from each other by any spatial or discrete symmetries. We formulate the effective Hamiltonian description of the system at low energies (of the order of the level spacing in the single-particle localization volume). In the metallic phase quantum Boltzmann equation is valid, allowing to find the kinetic coefficients. In the insulating phase, T {\textless} T c , we use Feynmann diagram technique to determine the probability distribution function for quantum-mechanical transition rates. The probability of an escape rate from a given quantum state to be finite turns out to vanish in every order of the perturbation theory in electron–electron interaction. Thus, electron–electron interaction alone is unable to cause the relaxation and establish the thermal equilibrium. As soon as some weak coupling to a bath is turned on, conductivity becomes finite even in the insulating phase. Moreover, in the vicinity of the transition temperature it is much larger than phonon-induced hopping conductivity of non-interacting electrons. The reason for this enhancement is that the},

abstract = {Computer simulation of observable phenomena is an indispensable tool for engineering new technology, understanding the natural world, and studying human society. However, the most interesting systems are often so complex that simulating their future behavior demands storing immense amounts of information regarding how they have behaved in the past. For increasingly complex systems, simulation becomes increasingly difficult and is ultimately constrained by resources such as computer memory. Recent theoretical work shows that quantum theory can reduce this memory requirement beyond ultimate classical limits, as measured by a process' statistical complexity, C . We experimentally demonstrate this quantum advantage in simulating stochastic processes. Our quantum implementation observes a memory requirement of C q = 0.05 ± 0.01, far below the ultimate classical limit of C = 1. Scaling up this technique would substantially reduce the memory required in simulations of more complex systems.},

In the spectrum of chaotic systems, the localized and random states interact with one another and modifies the spectral statistics. In this work, a 3 × 3 random matrix model is used to obtain exact result for the ratio of spacing between a generic and localized state.

@article{Esposito2009a,
abstract = {The total entropy production of a trajectory can be split into an adiabatic and a nonadiabatic contribution, deriving, respectively, from the breaking of detailed balance via nonequilibrium boundary conditions or by external driving. We show that each of them, the total, the adiabatic, and the nonadiabatic trajectory entropy, separately satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem. Small systems are subject to fluctuations. As a result, the energy Q that such a system absorbs from its surrounding reservoir during a given time interval will be a random variable, functional of the specific trajectory followed by the state of the system in the meantime. If the reservoir can be regarded as an idealized thermal reservoir, remaining all the time at equilibrium at a given temperature {\`{A}}1 (we set k B ¼ 1), one concludes that the change in its entropy {\'{A}}S r ¼ {\`{A}}Q is also a random variable. Such trajectory entropy has to be distinguished from its ensemble average h{\'{A}}S r i corresponding to the conventional thermodynamic entropy. In thermostated [1] and stochastic systems [2], it was shown that the probability distribution of {\'{A}}S r obeys an asymptotic detailed fluctuation theorem (FT) of the form Pð{\'{A}}S r Þ=Pð{\`{A}}{\'{A}}S r Þ {\$} expð{\'{A}}S r Þ. The result was derived under steady state conditions for a system with bounded energy and in the limit of a large time interval. It was subsequently realized [3] that this asymptotic FT resulted from a detailed FT for the total entropy {\'{A}}S tot , obtained by adding the system entropy {\'{A}}S to the reservoir entropy {\'{A}}S r , valid for all times and for any initial condition, Pð{\'{A}}S tot Þ= " Pð{\`{A}}{\'{A}}S tot Þ ¼ expð{\'{A}}S tot Þ. The overbar refers to the fact that in the presence of an external driving, the time-reversed driving has to be considered. It implies an integral FT, namely, hexpð{\`{A}}{\'{A}}S tot Þi ¼ 1, leading in its turn to h{\'{A}}S tot i ! 0, in agreement with the second law of ther-modynamics. The asymptotic FT follows in the long time limit when {\'{A}}S is bounded and {\'{A}}S r {\$} t becomes dominant. For systems with nonbounded energy the steady state FT can be broken [4]. In the case of an externally driven system initially at (canonical) equilibrium with temperature {\`{A}}1 , the total entropy production can be expressed as {\'{A}}S tot ¼ ðW {\`{A}} {\'{A}}FÞ, where W denotes the work performed on the system and {\'{A}}F is the free energy difference of the system between its final and initial equilibrium states. The detailed FT thus becomes the Crooks relation PðWÞ= " Pð{\`{A}}WÞ ¼ exp½ðW {\`{A}} {\'{A}}FÞ and its integrated version , the Jarzynski equality hexpð{\`{A}}WÞi ¼ expð{\`{A}}{\'{A}}FÞ. Both FTs have been derived for stochastic as well as microscopic dynamics [5,6] with the assumption of weak coupling between system and reservoir (see, however, [7]). Other FTs have been derived. The integral (detailed) Hatano-Sasa FT [8,9] ([10]) for the quantity Q ex {\`{A}} {\'{A}}S is a generalization of the Jarzynski (Crooks) relation to situations where the system starts and ends in a nonequi-librium steady state. Q ex is called the excess heat. We finally mention the Speck-Seifert integral FT for the so-called housekeeping heat Q hk ¼ Q {\`{A}} Q ex [9,11]. The work and FT discussed above basically extend the pioneering ideas of Onsager on the implications of micro-reversibility to (small) nonequilibrium systems. Their application and experimental verification have been the object of several reviews [9,12,13]. Nevertheless, there is still some confusion in the literature due to the various forms of the FTs and the conditions under which they apply. The purpose of this Letter is to clarify the situation with the derivation of three basic FTs. One of them is the ''standard'' theorem for the total entropy production {\'{A}}S tot. The aforementioned natural separation into a reservoir contribution {\'{A}}S r and system contribution {\'{A}}S suffers from the deficiency that these quantities themselves do not obey a FT. As we proceed to show, there is, however, another separation of the total entropy, {\'{A}}S tot ¼ {\'{A}}S na þ {\'{A}}S a , where the so-called nonadiabatic {\'{A}}S na and adiabatic component {\'{A}}S a satisfy, each separately, a detailed and integral FT. These contributions have a physical meaning as they correspond to two basic ways in which a system can be brought out of equilibrium, namely, by driving the system by a time dependent force or by applying steady nonequilibrium constraints. Furthermore, in the case of a single heat reservoir {\'{A}}S a ¼ {\`{A}}Q hk and if in addition only transitions between steady states are considered , {\'{A}}S na ¼ {\'{A}}S {\`{A}} Q ex [14]. Under these conditions, the aforementioned corresponding FTs are in fact FTs for {\'{A}}S a and {\'{A}}S na. Before embarking on the general derivation of the FTs for total entropy, and its adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions , we make a number of revealing mathematical PRL 104, 090601 (2010) P H Y S I C A L},

abstract = {In many quantum gravity approaches, the cosmological constant is introduced by deforming the gauge group into a quantum group. In three dimensions, the quantization of the Chern-Simons formulation of gravity provided the first example of such a deformation. The Turaev-Viro model, which is an example of a spin-foam model, is also defined in terms of a quantum group. By extension, it is believed that in four dimensions, a quantum group structure could encode the presence of $\Lambda$ ≠ 0. In this article, we introduce by hand the quantum group U q ðsuð2ÞÞ into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework; that is, we deal with U q ðsuð2ÞÞ-spin networks. We explore some of the consequences, focusing in particular on the structure of the observables. Our fundamental tools are tensor operators for U q ðsuð2ÞÞ. We review their properties and give an explicit realization of the spinorial and vectorial ones. We construct the generalization of the UðNÞ formalism in this deformed case, which is given by the quantum group U q ðuðNÞÞ. We are then able to build geometrical observables, such as the length, area or angle operators, etc. We show that these operators characterize a quantum discrete hyperbolic geometry in the three-dimensional LQG case. Our results confirm that a quantum group structure in LQG can be a tool to introduce a nonzero cosmological constant into the theory.

abstract = {Environmental noise and disorder play critical roles in quantum particle and wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems. While separately both effects are known to reduce transport, recent work predicts that in a limited region of parameter space, noise-induced dephasing can counteract localization effects, leading to enhanced quantum transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal of developing large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor: a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 64,400 experiments we observe distinct transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the 'quantum Goldilocks' regime in statically disordered discrete-time systems. Low-loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.},

The result is a model in which boundary re-gions allow the reconstruction of bulk algebras with central elements living on the interior edges of the (greedy) entanglement wedge, and where these central elements can also be reconstructed from complementary boundary regions. In addition, the entropy of bound-ary regions receives both Ryu-Takayanagi-like contributions and further corrections that model the $\delta$Area 4G N term of Faulkner, Lewkowycz, and Maldacena. Comparison with Yang-Mills theory then suggests that this $\delta$Area 4G N term can be reinterpreted as a part of the bulk entropy of gravitons under an appropriate extension of the physical bulk Hilbert space.},

In analogy to the time average of a classical phase-space dynamics, it is intimately related to the ergodic properties of the quantum system giving information on the spreading of the initial state in the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In this work we apply a concept from quantum information, known as total correlations, to the diagonal ensemble. Forming an upper bound on the multipartite entanglement, it quantifies the combination of both classical and quantum correlations in a mixed state. We generalize the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble to more general $\alpha$-Renyi entropies and focus on the cases $\alpha$ = 1 and $\alpha$ = 2 with further numerical extensions in mind. Here we show that the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble is a generic indicator of ergodicity breaking, displaying a subextensive behavior when the system is ergodic. We demonstrate this by investigating its scaling in a range of spin chain models focusing not only on the cases of integrability breaking but also emphasize its role in understanding the transition from an ergodic to a many-body localized phase in systems with disorder or quasiperiodicity.},

abstract = {We introduce a measure Q of bipartite quantum correlations for arbitrary two-qubit states, expressed as a state-independent function of the density matrix elements. The amount of quantum correlations can be quantified experimentally by measuring the expectation value of a small set of observables on up to four copies of the state, without the need for a full tomography. We extend the measure to 2 {\^{A}} d systems, providing its explicit form in terms of observables and applying it to the relevant class of multiqubit states employed in the deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit model. The number of required measurements to determine Q in our scheme does not increase with d. Our results provide an experimentally friendly framework to estimate quantitatively the degree of general quantum correlations in composite systems. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.150403 PACS numbers: 03.65.Ta, 03.65.Yz, 03.67.Lx, 03.67.Mn Quantum entanglement is one of the most fundamental consequences of the superposition principle and undoubt-edly plays a key role in designing faster-than-classical algorithms, teleportation protocols, and superdense coding [1]. However, it may not be the ultimate resource behind the power of quantum computation [2]. It has been recently found that, even with no entanglement, some mixed-state based schemes [such as the so-called deterministic quan-tum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1) [3]] allow an improvement of performance in computing tasks [4], and, more generally, separable states possess genuinely quantum correlations (QCs) [5], captured, e.g., by the quantum discord [6,7], which cannot be described within a classical scenario [6–11]. In general, QCs in a state AB can be defined as the minimum amount of total correlations (measured, e.g., by the mutual information) between Alice and Bob that are destroyed by a local measurement on one or both subsystems [6–8,10,12–15]. For pure states, QCs coincide with entanglement [6]. For mixed states, even if some operational interpretations have been proposed [11,15–18], basic technical issues still prevent us from reaching a full comprehension of their nature. Indeed, theoretical evaluation and experimental detection of QCs both represent hard challenges: Any attempt to determine the QCs in a given state AB is hindered by the difficulty of solving an optimization to determine the least disturbing measurement for that state, thus requiring the full knowl-edge of it. Recently, some nontomographic detection schemes for witnessing nonvanishing QCs by measuring just one observable have been proposed and implemented [14,19,20]. However, by noting that all states possess non-zero QCs but a null-measure set [21], the most worthwhile question becomes that of evaluating, by a proper measure, the actual amount of QCs encoded in a state. Only then can quantitative connections be drawn between the QC content and the performance of some quantum protocol using them as a resource [4,22,23]. In this Letter, we show that QCs in a general two-qubit state can be reliably quantified without any explicit optimization and with no need to know the full shape of the state. We define a QC measure Q which is a state-independent function of the density matrix elements. In particular, Q can be expressed in terms of the expectation values of a set of nine observables fO i g. Consequently, such a function could be evaluated by designing simple quantum circuits simulating the measurements of fhO i ig [24–31]. However, following the alternative approach of Refs. [32–34], we further show that the quantity Q can be even less demandingly measured by performing seven local projections on up to four copies of the state . Then, we extend our measure to capture bipartite QCs in states of 2 {\^{A}} d dimensional systems, finding that seven projective measurements are always sufficient to experi-mentally determine Q; i.e., the number of measurements required is independent of d. Specifically, we use this construction to obtain a quantitative estimate of QCs in a recent experimental implementation [35] of the DQC1 model [3] with four qubits. A number of conceptually different measures of general QCs have been recently proposed [5–8,10,12–15]. In the following, we consider a two-qubit state AB and adopt a geometric perspective, quantifying the QCs in terms of the minimum distance of from the set of classical-quantum states. The states 2 filling such a set are left unperturbed by at least one choice of projective measurement on Alice and take the form [11] ¼ P i p i jiihij iB , where p i are probabilities, fjiig is an orthonormal vector set, and iB is the marginal density matrix of Bob.

abstract = {The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems 1,2 in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluor-escence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial require-ment for the implementation of novel cooling schemes 3 . Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have proved to be powerful simulators for the investigation of the static quantum phases and dynamical evolutions of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Prominent examples include the quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator 4–7 and the fermionized Tonks– Girardeau gas for bosonic particles 8,9 , as well as the recently realized fermionic Mott insulator 10,11 . In all these cases, the strong interactions between the particles compared to their kinetic energy generate intri-guing highly correlated quantum states that are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics and promising for practical applications in quantum information science. For many of these applications it is of crucial importance to image the correlated many-body systems with single-atom and single-site resolution. One could then, for example, probe the evolution from a Poissonian atom number distribution into highly number-squeezed Fock states on a lattice not only globally 12 but also on a local scale. Furthermore, one should be able to observe critical phenomena directly in the in situ density or in spin-resolved images of the particles when approaching a quantum critical point. For applica-tions in quantum information science, it is essential to address and manipulate single atoms on individual lattice sites. A prominent example is the one-way quantum computer 13},

abstract = {Nonequilibrium processes of small systems such as molecular machines are ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and physics but are often challenging to comprehend. In the past two decades, several exact thermodynamic relations of nonequilibrium processes, collectively known as fluctuation theorems, have been discovered and provided critical insights. These fluctuation theorems are generalizations of the second law and can be unified by a differential fluctuation theorem. Here we perform the first experimental test of the differential fluctuation theorem using an optically levitated nanosphere in both underdamped and overdamped regimes and in both spatial and velocity spaces. We also test several theorems that can be obtained from it directly, including a generalized Jarzynski equality that is valid for arbitrary initial states, and the Hummer-Szabo relation. Our study experimentally verifies these fundamental theorems and initiates the experimental study of stochastic energetics with the instantaneous velocity measurement. In the past two decades, there were significant developments in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of small systems in which thermal fluctuation is influential [1]. The most prominent progress is the discovery of various fluctuation theorems (FTs), which connect microscopic dynamics with thermodynamic behaviors [1]. These FTs, such as the Jarzynski equality (JE) [2,3] and the Crooks fluctuation theorem (CFT) [4,5], reformulate the inequality of the second law into equalities and reveal the universal laws that the fluctuating thermodynamic variables must obey in processes arbitrarily far from thermal equilibrium. As they are refinements of the second law on individual trajectories, they provide critical understanding of behaviors of biological systems at the single molecular level [3,5-10] and nonequilibrium dynamics of a wide range of physical systems [11-28]. While JE and CFT are valid for processes far from thermal equilibrium, they require the initial state to be in a thermal equilibrium state. In 2000, a differential fluctuation theorem (DFT) connecting the joint probabilities of entropy production and arbitrary generalized coordinates (e.g., position and velocity coordinates) was derived by Jarzynski [29]. An equivalent DFT for work was derived by Nobel laureate Karplus and co-workers in 2008 [20]. It is remarkable that the DFT can unify various FTs as long as detailed balance is not violated [20] (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material [30] for the relation between different fluctuation theorems). The DFT also leads to a generalized Jarzynski equality (GJE) for arbitrary initial states [24]. Such an ability is rooted from the fact that most FTs originate from the same fundamental principle: the microscopic reversibility connecting forward and reverse trajectories [1,18,24,29,31-33]. Testing the DFT and other FTs would deepen our understanding of the second law and nonequilibrium physics, including dissipation [19], hysterisis [34], and irreversibility [35]. In order to test the DFT at its desired level of detail, we need large statistics and the ability to track individual trajectories of a stochastic process in the phase space [20], which requires the measurement of instantaneous velocities of Brownian motion [36]. In this work, we experimentally test the differential fluctuation theorem [20,29] using an optically levitated nanosphere which can be trapped in air continuously for weeks for acquiring large sets of data. Our ultrasensitive optical tweezer can measure both instantaneous position and instantaneous velocity [36] of a levitated nanosphere to test DFT. Over one million experimental cycles per setting (∼10 10 position data points per setting with a 10-MHz acquisition rate) provide sufficient statistics to validate the DFT at its desired level of detail, e.g., testing DFT for nonequilibrium processes connecting two points in the position-velocity space [20].

abstract = {We consider the problem of defining localized subsystems in gauge theory and gravity. Such systems are associated to spacelike hypersurfaces with boundaries and provide the natural setting for studying entanglement entropy of localized subsystems. We present a general formalism to associate a gauge-invariant classical phase space to a spatial slice with boundary by introducing new degrees of freedom on the boundary. In Yang-Mills theory the new degrees of freedom are a choice of gauge on the boundary, transformations of which are generated by the normal component of the nonabelian electric field. In general relativity the new degrees of freedom are the location of a codimension-2 surface and a choice of conformal normal frame. These degrees of freedom transform under a group of surface symmetries, consisting of diffeomorphisms of the codimension-2 boundary, and position-dependent linear deformations of its normal plane. We find the observables which generate these symmetries, consisting of the conformal normal metric and curvature of the normal connection. We discuss the implications for the problem of defining entanglement entropy in quantum gravity. Our work suggests that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may arise from the different ways of gluing together two partial Cauchy surfaces at a cross-section of the horizon.},

Two condensates separated by approximately 40 micrometers were created by evaporatively cooling sodium atoms in a double-well potential formed by magnetic and optical forces. High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of approximately 15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are "laser-like"; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations. These results have direct implications for the atom laser and the Josephson effect for atoms.},

abstract = {The modern form of the Moments Method applied to the calculation of the nuclear shell-model level density is explained and examples of the method at work are given. The calculated level density practically exactly coincides with the result of full diagonalization when the latter is feasible. The method provides the pure level density for given spin and parity with spurious center-of-mass excitations subtracted. The presence and interplay of all correlations leads to the results different from those obtained by the mean-field combinatorics. The long-standing problem of nuclear level density is important both from a theoretical viewpoint as a powerful instrument for studying nuclear structure and for numerous applications. Nuclear technology requires the detailed knowledge of level density, especially in the region around the neutron separation energy. Astrophysical reactions responsible for the nucleosynthesis in the Universe can be understood only if we know the nuclear level density in the Gamow window. The interest to this problem is also connected with the necessity to develop methods of statistical physics and thermodynamics for small mesoscopic systems (complex nuclei, atoms and molecules, nanoscale devices, prototypes of quantum computers). Application of statistical physics to studies of nuclear properties was started in the early years of nuclear physics by Frenkel [1], Bethe [2, 3] and Landau [4]. Such ideas served as a base for a concept of compound nucleus by Bohr [5]. The review of those ideas and their further development was given in Refs. [6, 7]. At this stage theory of level density and detailed microscopic nuclear theory were growing more or less independently along parallel paths. Their synthesis became possible when the reliable versions of the nuclear shell model were established for several segments of the nuclear chart. Of course, this is related to the modern computational tools. In this presentation we show the practical way of finding the density of energy levels with fixed exact quantum numbers (spin, parity, isospin projection) for a given shell model Hamiltonian. The method becomes practical because it is avoiding the full diagonalization of prohibitively large matrices. In contrast to popular mean-field approaches [8-10], all many-body correlations are fully accounted for, albeit in a restricted orbital space. The exact classification of states according to the conserved quantities and therefore the absence of artificial standard spin cutoff parameters is the advantage compared to Monte-Carlo calculations although some of them give relatively good results [11, 12]. Similar problems still may arise in approaches based on statistical spectroscopy [13]. Our method was gradually developed in several publications [14-22]. A high-performance code for calculating spin-and parity-dependent level density is available via the Computer},

Measurements described by the one-dimensional projectors lj)(jl can distinguish I@) and lg) according to the classical metric (1). The quantum distinguishability metric should be defined by measurements that resolve the two states optimally-i.e. , that maximize Eq. (1). The maximum is given by the Hilbert-space angle cos t(1(pig) I), which clearly captures a notion of state distinguishability. The corresponding line element,-, 'dsps-= [cos '(l(414) I)]' = 1-l(@14» I' = (A'{\~{}} I+'{\~{}}) 2"' 2 2 (4) called the Fubini-Study metric [2], is the natural metric on the manifold of Hilbert-space rays.

The term in large square brackets, the variance of the phase changes, is non-negative; an appropriate choice One task of precision quantum measurements is to detect a weak signal that produces a small change in the state of some quantum system. Given an initial quantum state, the size of the signal parametrizes a path through the space of quantum states. Detecting a weak signal is thus equivalent to distinguishing neighboring quantum states along the path. We pursue this point of view by using the theory of parameter estimation to formulate the problem of distinguishing neighboring states. We find measurements that optimally resolve neighboring states, and we characterize their degree of distinguishability in terms of a Riemannian metric, increasing distance corresponding to more reliable distinguishability. These considerations lead directly to uncertainty principles that are more general and more stringent than standard uncertainty principles. We begin by reviewing Wootters's derivation [1] of a distinguishability metric for probability distributions. After drawing N samples from a probability distribution, one can estimate the probabilities p{\~{}} as the observed frequencies f{\~{}}, The probability for the frequencies is given by a multinomial distribution, which for large N is proportional to a Gaussian exp[-(N/2)(f{\~{}}-p{\~{}})2/p{\~{}}] A. nearby distribution pz can be reliably distinguished from ps if the Gaussian exp[-(N/2)(p{\~{}}-ps) /p{\~{}}] is small.

Using a Langevin equation, we find the exact Fourier transform of the distribution of these fluctuations for all. By a saddle-point method we obtain analytical results for the inverse Fourier transform, which, for not too small , agree very well with numerical results from a sampling method as well as from the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Due to the interaction of the deterministic part of the motion of the particle in the mechanical potential with the stochastic part of the motion caused by the fluid, the conventional heat fluctuation theorem is, for infinite and for finite , replaced by an extended fluctuation theorem that differs noticeably and measurably from it. In particular, for large fluctuations, the ratio of the probability for absorption of heat (by the particle from the fluid) to the probability to supply heat (by the particle to the fluid) is much larger here than in the conventional fluctuation theorem.},

abstract = {Continuous-time stochastic processes pervade everyday experience, and the simulation of models of these processes is of great utility. Classical models of systems operating in continuous-time must typically track an unbounded amount of information about past behaviour, even for relatively simple models, enforcing limits on precision due to the finite memory of the machine. However, quantum machines can require less information about the past than even their optimal classical counterparts to simulate the future of discrete-time processes, and we demonstrate that this advantage extends to the continuous-time regime. Moreover, we show that this reduction in the memory requirement can be unboundedly large, allowing for arbitrary precision even with a finite quantum memory. We provide a systematic method for finding superior quantum constructions, and a protocol for analogue simulation of continuous-time renewal processes with a quantum machine.},

abstract = {The many-body problem is ubiquitous in the theoretical description of physical phenomena, ranging from the behaviour of elementary particles to the physics of electrons in solids. Most of our understanding of many-body systems comes from analysing the symmetric properties of Hamiltonian and states: the most striking examples are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of systems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several approaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge theories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation platforms have been put forward for the realisation of synthetic gauge theories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum information concepts have been formulated. In this review, we present an introduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and highlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and report the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.},

abstract = {{\%}'e consider here a 10 tight-binding model with two uncorrelated random site energies e, and eb and a constant nearest-neighbor matrix element V. We show that if one (or both) of the site energies is as-signed at random to pairs of lattice sites (that is, two sites in succession), an initially localized particle can become delocalized. Its mean-square displacement at long times is sho{\~{}}n to grow in time as j' ' provided that — 2V(r, — eb {\&} 2V. DiN'usion occurs if e, — eb + 2V and localization otherwise. The dual of the random-dimer model is also shown to exhibit an absence of localization and is shown to be relevant to transmission resonances in Fibonacci lattices. PACS numbers: 71.50.+t, 72. 15.Rn The Anderson model for site-diagonal disorder has proven to be of fundamental importance in our under-standing of the role disorder plays in insulator-metal transitions in a wide range of materials, most notably Si:P. ' A well-known result of the Anderson model for site-energy disorder is the vanishing of the diffusion con-stant of an initially localized particle for any amount of disorder in one and two dimensions. In this paper, we consider probably the simplest tight-binding model that exhibits Anderson localization. We focus on a one-dimensional tight-binding model of a random binary al-loy in which the site energies e, and eb are assigned at random to the lattice sites with probability q and 1 — q, respectively. A constant nearest-neighbor matrix ele-ment V mediates transport between the lattice sites. In one dimension, it is well accepted that for all nonzero q, all the eigenstates will be exponentially localized and no long-range transport will be observed at long times. 3 Consider, for the moment, a particular realization of the site energies in a certain segment of the infinite lat-{\~{}} {\~{}} {\~{}} {\&}a {\&}a {\&}b {\&}a {\&}a {\&}a {\&}b eb e{\~{}} E'b eb {\&}b {\&}b E'{\~{}}. . . . Given the rigorous nature of the theorems establishing quasiparti-cle localization in one-dimension, it seems safe to assume that the one-dimensional results are not only indepen-dent of q, but also of the number of e, 's or eb's that ap-pear in clusters in the lattice. That is, the localization of one-dimensional quasiparticles still persists if all clusters containing an odd number of eb's are replaced by clus-ters containing an odd number of e, 's, for example. After all, under such a transformation, the system is still random and the localization theorems guarantee an ab-sence of transport for any degree of randomness in one dimension. We show here that this is not the case. In particular, we show that when one of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites (that is, two sites in succession), JN of the electronic states are ex-tended over the entire sample. In addition, we show that the tight-binding model that describes this system is equivalent to a simplified version of the correlated disor-der model recently proposed by Dunlap, Kundu, and Phillips (DKP). We refer to a lattice in which at least one of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of m =pm {\~{}}C{\~{}} {\~{}} (2) Our calculations were performed on a self-expanding chain with the localized initial condition Co(t=0) =l. The self-expanding chain was used to minimize end effects; whenever the probability of finding the particle at the ends of the chain exceeded 10,ten new sites were added to each end. The results from several random samples are shown in Fig. 1. The site energies were chosen from the bivalued distribution e " =t. , and e " =eh with q = 2 . This choice of q corresponds to the most disordered case. Figure 1 compares the mean-square displacement in the random-dimer model for three different values of e eb'. (a) e eb = V, (b) e fb =2V, and (c) e, — eb =3V. The dotted curves are the lattice sites as the random-dimer model. We show by numerical simulation that the mean-square displacement of an initially localized particle in the random-dimer model will grow as t provided that — 2V{\&} 8 Eb (2V. Diffusion is shown to occur when e, eb =+'2V. In all other cases, the particle remains localized at long times. Our results are shown to be valid even when both e, and eb are individually assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites. This case is certainly more surprising than the former because it seems reasonable to assume that such a system is equivalent to the completely random binary alloy with two sites per unit cell. Here again, we show that this is not the case. We close by showing how an absence of localization can occur in a random two im-purity model even when the pairing constraint is relaxed. The connection between such a model and transport in Fibonacci lattices5 is discussed. This work certainly sug-gests that a number of physically relevant models might exist that exhibit an absence of localization.

abstract = {This review focuses on the field of quantum entanglement applied to condensed matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial information can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated R{\'{e}}nyi entropies are now well recognized to contain key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce non-trivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in detail. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.},

abstract = {In the context of the coarse-graining of loop quantum gravity, we introduce loopy and tagged spin networks, which generalize the standard spin network states to account explicitly for non-trivial curvature and torsion. Both structures relax the closure constraints imposed at the spin network vertices. While tagged spin networks merely carry an extra spin at every vertex encoding the overall closure defect, loopy spin networks allow for an arbitrary number of loops attached to each vertex. These little loops can be interpreted as local excitations of the quantum gravitational field and we discuss the statistics to endow them with. The resulting Fock space of loopy spin networks realizes new truncation of loop quantum gravity, allowing to formulate its graph-changing dynamics on a fixed background graph plus local degrees of freedom attached to the graph nodes. This provides a framework for re-introducing a non-trivial background quantum geometry around which we would study the effective dynamics of perturbations. We study how to implement the dynamics of topological BF theory in this framework. We realize the projection on flat connections through holonomy constraints and we pay special attention to their often overlooked non-trivial flat solutions defined by higher derivatives of the $\delta$-distribution.},

@article{VanZon2003,
abstract = {Heat fluctuations are studied in a dissipative system with both deterministic and stochastic components for a simple model: a Brownian particle dragged through water by a moving potential. An extension of the stationary state fluctuation theorem is derived. For infinite time, this reduces to the conventional fluctuation theorem only for small fluctuations; for large fluctuations, it gives a much larger ratio of the probabilities of the particle to absorb rather than supply heat. This persists for finite times and should be observable in experiments similar to a recent one carried out by Wang et al. There is a lack of unifying principles in nonequili-brium statistical mechanics, compared to the equilibrium case. So it is not surprising that the fluctuation theorem has received a lot of attention, as it gives a property of fluctuations of entropy production for a large class of systems, possibly arbitrarily far from equilibrium [1-10]. Here, we prefer to use the term heat rather than entropy production, so that the conventional stationary state fluctuation theorem (SSFT) [11] states that the probability P Q  to find a value of Q for the amount of heat dissipated in a time interval satisfies, in a nonequili-brium stationary state [1,3], P Q  P {\"{y}}Q  e Q ; (1) where indicates the behavior for large. Here  k B T {\"{y}}1 , with k B Boltzmann's constant and T the (effec-tive) temperature of the system. In contrast, the transient fluctuation theorem (TFT) considers fluctuations Q in time, when the system is initially in equilibrium [2]. These theorems were first demonstrated in (isoenergetic) deterministic many particle systems in an external field [1-3], but later in stochastic systems as well [4,5]. In contrast to our formulation in terms of heat, in the literature, Eq. (1) is interpreted as a theorem for fluctuations of entropy production far from equilibrium, by identifying Q =T as a (generalized) entropy production. Furthermore, the fluctuation theorem holds for arbitrary values of Q , i.e., also far from its average. Hence, it is often referred to as a large deviation theorem. Recently, a laboratory experiment was carried out by Wang et al. [8]. They measured fluctuations in the work done on a system in a transient state of a Brownian particle in water, subject to a moving, confining potential. The TFT for work fluctuations was confirmed. In the deterministic models, dissipation is often mod-eled by including a damping term in the equations of motion, chosen such as to keep, e.g., the total energy of the system fixed. This damping term is a mechanical expression for what in reality is an external thermostat. Any work done by the external field on the system is absorbed by this ''internal'' thermostat. Therefore, the external work done on the system equals the heat dissipated in the system. While Wang et al. intended to study the entropy production (or heat) fluctuations, in fact, the work fluctuations were studied [10]. In contrast to the above sketched purely deterministic models, work fluctuations differ from heat fluctuations in their system due to the presence of a confining potential. Thus, some of the external work done is converted into potential energy and only the rest is converted into heat. In fact, in this system the work fluctuations in the stationary state satisfy the conventional SSFT [10,12], but the heat fluctuations do not, as we shall show. As it turns out, in the presence of a deterministic together with a stochastic component, the resulting behavior of the heat fluctuations coincides with the conventional SSFTonly for a restricted set of small fluctuations while the behavior is very different for larger ones. We first discuss the work-related fluctuation theorem in the experiment of Wang et al., which was treated theoretically in Refs. [10,12,13]. The Brownian particle in a fluid, subject to a harmonic potential moving with constant velocity v , was described by an overdamped Langevin equation: dx t dt  {\"{y}}x t {\"{y}} x t   t : (2) Here, x t is the position of the particle at time t, x t  v t is the position of the minimum of the harmonic potential at time t, and t is a fluctuating force with zero mean and a delta function correlation in time. We remark that the relaxation time of the position of the particle has been set equal to one. Also, we set k B T  1, so h t s i  2t {\"{y}} s},

abstract = {We study the onset of chaos and statistical relaxation in two isolated dynamical quantum systems of interacting spins 1/2, one of which is integrable and the other chaotic. Our approach to identifying the emergence of chaos is based on the level of delocalization of the eigenstates with respect to the energy shell, the latter being determined by the interaction strength between particles or quasiparticles. We also discuss how the onset of chaos may be anticipated by a careful analysis of the Hamiltonian matrices, even before diagonalization. We find that despite differences between the two models, their relaxation processes following a quench are very similar and can be described analytically with a theory previously developed for systems with two-body random interactions. Our results imply that global features of statistical relaxation depend on the degree of spread of the eigenstates within the energy shell and may happen to both integrable and nonintegrable systems.

abstract = {Ultracold quantum gases offer a unique setting for quantum simulation of interacting many-body systems. The high degree of controllability, the novel detection possibilities and the extreme physical parameter regimes that can be reached in these 'artificial solids' provide an exciting complementary set-up compared with natural condensed-matter systems, much in the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum simulator. Here we review recent advances in technology and discuss progress in a number of areas where experimental results have already been obtained. C alculate or simulate? Predicting the evolution of a multi-component system is often a challenge that can be solved either by direct mathematical analysis or by a device that simulates its behaviour. In many cases the latter approach may offer a faster solution, better accuracy and/or a more illustrative representation than possible with available numerical methods. A celebrated example is the ensemble of astronomical clocks that were built in Asia and Europe in the period between 1000 and 1500. They were used to predict the position of the planets and the constellations, the phases of the moon and its eclipses. The general interest in the simulation of physical phenomena has been greatly revitalized during the past decade. This renaissance results from the conjunction of new needs and new tools. The new needs originate in the increasing role of quantum effects in the states of matter relevant for modern technology 1 . The computational power required to describe an assembly of particles in quantum physics increases exponentially with the number of its constituents. The numerical description of a sample of quantum matter is thus often limited to a small number of constituents, and this may prevent one from addressing with the desired accuracy important phenomena such as high-T c superconductivity. The new tools have emerged thanks to recent advances in the control of atomic gases. Here, we will restrict ourselves to the case of neutral atom assemblies, well suited for the analog simulation of complex quantum systems. The design of an analog simulator starts with the proper mapping of the Hamiltonian of the system to be simulated. This includes both single-particle physics and the interaction between the constituents. Next, one should prepare the simulator in a state which is relevant for the physical problem of interest. This can be a well-identified quantum state (for example, the ground state) or an equilibrium state at non-zero temperature. Finally, one must perform measurements on the simulator with the highest-possible precision. We show that quantum atomic gases provide a unique way to fulfil all the stages of this programme. We have chosen three topics to illustrate the power of cold-atom assemblies for implementing analog quantum simulation. The first one deals with the control of interactions provided by Feshbach resonances. We focus on the very strongly interacting regime, where the fluid becomes scale-invariant and its behaviour is characterized by a few dimensionless coefficients. This gas forms a simulator for other strongly interacting fluids, a notion that is validated by comparing the measured coefficients with the results of state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The second topic deals with the control of the energy landscape at the level of the single-particle Hamiltonian. We choose the paradigmatic example},

abstract = {The physical description of all materials is rooted in quantum mechanics, which describes how atoms bond and electrons interact at a fundamental level. Although these quantum eeects can in many cases be approximated by a classical description at the macroscopic level, in recent years there has been growing interest in material systems where quantum eeects remain manifest over a wider range of energy and length scales. Such quantum materials include superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, quantum spin liquids, and spin ices. Many of them derive their properties from reduced dimensionality, in particular from confinement of electrons to two-dimensional sheets. Moreover, they tend to be materials in which electrons cannot be considered as independent particles but interact strongly and give rise to collective excitations known as quasiparticles. In all cases, however, quantum-mechanical eeects fundamentally alter properties of the material. This Review surveys the electronic properties of quantum materials through the prism of the electron wavefunction, and examines how its entanglement and topology give rise to a rich variety of quantum states and phases; these are less classically describable than conventional ordered states also driven by quantum mechanics, such as ferromagnetism. T he way we think about manifestations of quantum physics in materials has recently undergone a profound change of perspective. Although materials scientists and engineers have long exploited quantum effects in a range of electronic devices— well-known examples are the quantized electronic energy levels and optical selection rules at the heart of optoelectronics, and the tunnel effect that underlies the upcoming generation of hard-disk drives 1,2 —the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in our understanding of how subtle quantum effects control the macroscopic behaviour of a whole range of different materials. Two strange and beautiful aspects of quantum mechanics have come to the fore. One is the topological nature of quantum wave-functions. A familiar example is the existence of quantized vortices in superconductors. These vortices exist because of the requirement that the superconducting condensate have a well-defined phase, and gauge invariance fixes how this phase couples to magnetic flux. The phase can wind only by an integer multiple of 2$\pi$ around a vortex, and this integer winding number is a simple example of a topological invariant: a quantity that remains fixed under smooth changes of a system. Similar topological quantities turn out to govern many other kinds of materials, not just superconductors, and these sup-port phenomena ranging from dissipationless transport to novel quasiparticle excitations. Another deep feature of quantum mechanics is the non-local entanglement of some quantum states that is spectacularly high-lighted in teleportation experiments with two photons separated over macroscopic distances 3 .

abstract = {The Clausius inequality form of the second law of thermodynamics relates information changes (entropy) to changes in the first moment of the energy (heat and indirectly also work). Are there similar relations between other moments of the energy distribution, and other information measures, or is the Clausius inequality a one of a kind instance of the energy-information paradigm? If there are additional relations, can they be used to make predictions on measurable quantities? Changes in the energy distribution beyond the first moment (average heat or work) are especially important in small systems which are often very far from thermal equilibrium. The additional energy-information relations (AEIR's), here derived, provide positive answers to the two questions above and add another layer to the fundamental connection between energy and information. To illustrate the utility of the new AEIR's, we find scenarios where the AEIR's yield tighter constraints on performance (e.g., in thermal machines) compared to the second law. To obtain the AEIR's we use the Bregman divergence-a mathematical tool found to be highly suitable for energy-information studies. The quantum version of the AEIR's provides a thermodynamic meaning to various quantum coherence measures. It is intriguing to fully map the regime of validity of the AEIR's and extend the present results to more general scenarios including continuous systems and particles exchange with the baths.},

abstract = {A dissipative quantum system is treated here by coupling it with a heat bath of harmonic oscillators. Through quantum Langevin equations and Ehrenfest's theorem, we establish explicitly the quantum Duffing equations with a double-well potential chosen. A quantum noise term appears the only driving force in dynamics. Numerical studies show that the chaotic attractor exists in this system while chaos is certainly forbidden in the classical counterpart. [S0031-9007(97)03032-9] PACS numbers: 05.45.+ b, 03.65.Sq, 05.40.+ j, 42.50.Lc Quantum chaos of Hamiltonian systems has been studied extensively [1-4]. By contrast, very little work has been done in looking at quantum chaos of dissipative systems. Many quantum mechanical systems (e.g., SQUID with Josephson junction, an atom in a cavity of electromagnetic fields, NMR quantum measurements), however, are neither isolated nor Hamiltonian. These interact with their environment and thus are open in general and noisy and dissipative. Dissipation is relatively difficult to treat in a quantum system since it seems inevitable to deal with stochastic processes via, for instance, the commonly used master equation that is extremely difficult to solve numerically. Recently, Spiller and Ralph [5] studied a damped and driven nonlinear oscillator by using the quantum state diffusion model based on the assumed master equation of Lindblad form [6]. They simulated the behavior of one member of the ensemble with a single environment operator and found that the quantum noise "kicks" the motion between the chaotic and the periodic behavior and so smears out any fractal structure. In general, the quantum state diffusion method often demands an approximation of the effects of the complicated environment by simple operators and always has a problem regarding the dimension of the environment [7]. Brun [8] has tried to derive the quantum version of the forced and damped Duffing os-cillator through the decoherence approach which involves the path integral. As he noticed, performing calculations in the low-temperature limit is extremely difficult. In the high temperature limit, Brun also suggested that the quantum noise "smears out" the quantum maps based on Wigner distributions and that numerical computation cannot be efficiently done because of the necessity of enumerating all the possible histories and elements of the decoherence functional. The dissipative quantum system has been studied by means of several different theories, for instance, the influence functional approach of Feynman and Vernon [9] and its application to Brownian motion [10], the quantum Langevin equations [11], the master equations [5-7,11], etc. [12]. Among these, the quantum Langevin formalism is more interesting for us since the dynamics of quantum operators for the system can be explicitly given in a fashion quite similar to the classical one. Most of the above theories considered a generic model of the system-bath interaction. Recently, Pattanayak and Schieve [3] proposed a derivation of semiclassical dynamics directly from Heisenberg equations of motion via Ehrenfest's theorem where ostensible (apparent) quantum chaos was found for the conservative (Hamiltonian) system with a double-well potential. In this paper, we will study a dissipative quantum model similar to that of Refs. [9-11] and write explicitly the quantum Duffing equations for a system of double-well potential by means of Langevin formalism and Ehrenfest's theorem. Numerical results are now possible to obtain and show that chaotic attractors robustly exist in this model, whereas chaos is impossible for the corresponding classical Duffing system due to the absence of an external driving force. To do this, let us consider a particle of unit mass moving in a one-dimensional time-independent bounded potential V ˆ Q with its Hamiltonian, H sys 1 2 ˆ P 2 1 V ˆ Q. To introduce dissipation, we may take the system H sys linearly interacting with an external "heat bath" of many degrees of freedom, which here is assumed an assembly of harmonic oscillators [9-11]. The familiar example of this model is a system of an atom interacting with a bath of equilibrium photons. Then the complete Hamiltonian is [9-11], H ˆ P 2 2 1 V ˆ Q 1 X n},

We also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a " quantum secret sharing scheme " , and suggest a tensor network calculation that may settle the issue.

@article{Josefsson2018,
abstract = {Cyclical heat engines are a paradigm of classical thermo-dynamics, but are impractical for miniaturization because they rely on moving parts. A more recent concept is particle exchange (PE) heat engines, which uses energy filtering to control a thermally driven particle flow between two heat reservoirs 1,2. As they do not require moving parts and can be realized in solid-state materials, they are suitable for low-power applications and miniaturization. It was predicted that PE engines could reach the same thermodynamically ideal efficiency limits as those accessible to cyclical engines 3-6 , but this prediction has not been verified experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a PE heat engine based on a quantum dot (QD) embedded into a semiconductor nanowire. We directly measure the engine's steady-state electric power output and combine it with the calculated electronic heat flow to determine the electronic efficiency $\eta$. We find that at the maximum power conditions, $\eta$ is in agreement with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency 6-9 and that the overall maximum $\eta$ is in excess of 70{\%} of the Carnot efficiency while maintaining a finite power output. Our results demonstrate that thermoelectric power conversion can, in principle, be achieved close to the thermo-dynamic limits, with direct relevance for future hot-carrier photovoltaics 10 , on-chip coolers or energy harvesters for quantum technologies. Traditional closed-cycle heat engines are based on an enclosed working medium that exchanges heat, but not particles, with hot and cold thermal reservoirs at temperatures T H and T C , respectively. The engines' thermal efficiency is bounded by the fundamental Carnot limit $\eta$ C = (T H-T C)/T H (ref. 11). In practice, however, the goal is usually to optimize the efficiency at a maximum power: that is, to operate near the lower Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency = − T T 1 CA C H (ref. 7). The best Stirling engines, for example, reach thermal efficiencies slightly above 0.5$\eta$ C (ref. 12), comparable to the $\eta$ CA (Supplementary Section A). A drawback of cyclical engines is that they require moving parts, which severely limits low-power applications, for example, in sensors or wearables. By contrast, PE heat engines 2 require no moving elements as they operate by exchanging particles (for example, pho-tons 1 or electrons 4) between two heat reservoirs. Theory predicts that PE heat engines can be operated near $\eta$ C provided that, first, the energy at which particles are exchanged between reservoirs is limited to an energy band much narrower than kT H (refs 3,5,13) and, second, that said energy is adjusted such that the particle transfer produces no entropy 1-4,8. These conditions describe an ideal solid-state thermoelectric system 3,5. One way to achieve the required energy filtering in the solid state is to use a QD that is tunnel-coupled to two electron reservoirs 5,14. Single-electron orbital states that act as energetically sharp transmission channels (resonances) for electrons at energy $\epsilon$ 0 can be used as energy filters. According to theory, by adjusting $\epsilon$ 0 one can operate the system either near $\eta$ C (refs 4,14) or near $\eta$ CA (ref. 15). Experimentally, there has been significant progress in the study of the thermoelectric properties of QDs 16,17 and QD-based solid-state cooling devices 18. However, predictions about the achievable effi-ciencies in PE heat engines have not been experimentally investigated before as it is a challenge to fulfil all the requirements for quantitative tests simultaneously: an accurate reservoir thermom-etry, tunable and electrically non-invasive reservoir heating and a QD that approximates an ideal energy filter. In this work we explore whether it is possible to reach $\eta$ C and $\eta$ CA in PE heat engines based on QDs formed by thin InP segments embedded into InAs nanowires (Fig. 1a), as proposed previously 14. This system offers small and electrostatically stable QDs defined with atomic precision 19 and makes use of well-established device-fabrication techniques. The energy width of the resonance is determined by the tunnel rates $\Gamma$ across the InP segments, and an electrostatic gate can be used to control the resonance energy. The operation principle of our PE heat engine is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The resonance energy $\epsilon$ 0 is positioned relative to the chemical potentials of the electron reservoirs, $\mu$ C and $\mu$ H , such that electronic state occupancy at $\epsilon$ 0 is higher in the hot (red) reservoir than in the cold (blue) reservoir. In this configuration, the temperature difference ∆ T = (T H-T C) can drive an electric current I against an electrical potential difference V = ($\mu$ C-$\mu$ H)/e (ref. 4). In the limit ℏ$\Gamma$ → 0, electrons are transferred only at $\epsilon$ 0. Each transferred electron then produces electric work (eV) at the cost of removing heat Q H = $\epsilon$ 0-$\mu$ H from the hot reservoir and depositing Q C = $\epsilon$ 0-$\mu$ C in the cold reservoir. For finite $\Gamma$, this coupling between charge and heat is no longer exact because of a finite resonance width and effects such as co-tunnelling 20 , thus resulting in an increased heat flow. Also, the existence of a well-defined resonance energy $\epsilon$ 0 requires the single-particle level spacing to be much larger than kT H to avoid transport through the excited states of the QD. In the presence of a load R in series with the QD (Fig. 1c) and zero external bias V ext , the circuit self-consistently satisfies the relation V =-I th R, where I th = I(V ext = 0) is the thermocurrent. The thermoelec-trically produced power in the steady state is P th =-I th V = I th 2 R and the electronic efficiency is $\eta$ = P th /J Q , where J Q is the electronic heat flow that leaves the hot reservoir through the QD. We emphasize that P th and $\eta$ depend on R, which can thus be used to optimize either P th or $\eta$.},

This is done by demanding that the horizon state satisfying the boundary conditions be a Kubo-Martin-Schwinger state. The exact formula for the temperature can be derived by imposing the reality conditions in the form of the linear simplicity constraints for an imaginary Barbero-Immirzi parameter. Thus, our analysis reveals the connection between the analytic continuation to the Ashtekar self-dual variables and the thermality of the horizon. The horizon thermal equilibrium state can then be used to compute both the entanglement and the Boltzmann entropies. We show that the two provide the same finite answer, which allows us to recover the Bekenstein-Hawking formula in the semiclassical limit. In this way, we shed new light on the microscopic origin of black hole entropy by revealing the equivalence between the near-horizon degrees of freedom entanglement proposal and the state-counting interpretation.

abstract = {Ultracold atoms confined by engineered magnetic or optical potentials are ideal to study phenomena otherwise diicult to realize or probe in the solid state, thanks to the ability to control the atomic interaction strength, number of species, density and geometry. Here, we review quantum transport phenomena in atomic gases that mirror and can either better elucidate or show fundamental diierences with respect to those observed in mesoscopic and nanoscopic systems. We discuss the significant progress in transport experiments in atomic gases, the similarities and diierences between transport in cold atoms and in condensed matter systems, and survey theoretical predictions that are diicult to verify in conventional set-ups. A novel route to probe and manipulate transport of quantum matter was discovered when extremely cold (down to a few nanokelvin) and rarefied atomic gases (with typical density n ∼ 10 13 –10 15 cm −3 compared to n ∼ 10 22 cm −3 in solid-state systems) were used to realize the condensate of bosons predicted by Bose and Einstein in 1924 (ref. 1). These so-called ultracold gases are especially clean and controllable: as an example the inter-particle interaction takes a very simple form, namely that of an isotropic contact interaction parametrized only by the two-body scattering length, which can be externally tuned 1 , thereby accessing the entire range from the noninteracting limit to the strongly interacting limit. Table 1 contrasts cold-atom and electronic systems. These achievements have opened a new research field of ultracold atoms, where the flexibility in the parameter space allows them to be 'quantum simulators' 2–5 with the goal of mimicking the behaviour of complex quantum states of matter. An ambitious yet realistic direc-tion is to use ultracold atomic gases to study transport properties of quantum systems for which a complete theoretical understanding is still lacking. However, a major obstacle is that ultracold atomic gases are isolated systems unaffected by the external environment on the typical timescales of the dynamics ranging from milliseconds to seconds under the conditions of extremely low temperatures and density, and charge neutrality (see Table 1 and Fig. 1b,c). On the other hand, solid-state systems, such as the one shown in Fig. 1a, are intrinsically open systems and their transport coefficients are measured in the steady state maintained by the continuous exchange of energy or particles with external reservoirs. It is therefore crucial to examine if transport coefficients measured in ultracold-atom experiments can be directly compared to their counterparts in conventional solid-state devices. This may be the case, as recent experiments have laid the foundations for a systematic investigation of transport properties of ultracold atomic gases 6–17 . The isolated nature of cold-atom systems may well turn out to be one of their greatest advantages because one can focus solely on their intrinsic transport properties, while highlighting the differences with respect to condensed matter systems whose coupling to the environment and disorder cannot be neglected or easily engineered. Our aim is to provide an overview of the progress towards a better understanding of transport in quantum systems with the assistance of ultracold atomic experiments, and we will present a selection of what we believe are important achievements in this exciting and growing field.

abstract = {We study the time evolution of the amount of entanglement generated by one-dimensional spin-1/2 Ising-type Hamiltonians composed of many-body interactions. We investigate sets of states randomly selected during the time evolution generated by several types of time-independent Hamiltonians by analyzing the distributions of the amount of entanglement of the sets. We compare such entanglement distributions with that of typical entanglement, entanglement of a set of states randomly selected from a Hilbert space with respect to the unitarily invariant measure. We show that the entanglement distribution obtained by a time-independent Hamiltonian can simulate the average and standard deviation of the typical entanglement, if the Hamiltonian contains suitable many-body interactions. We also show that the time required to achieve such a distribution is polynomial in the system size for certain types of Hamiltonians.},

abstract = {Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations , stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and quantum correlations (QCs) in composite states. We focus on various approaches to define and quantify general QCs, based on different yet interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks fit to play a key role.},

For sufficiently weak disorder, the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all initial ordering, whereas above a critical disorder strength, a substantial portion of the initial ordering persists. The critical disorder value shows a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Our experiment paves the way to further detailed studies of MBL, such as in noncorrelated disorder or higher dimensions.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems without long-lived excitations (quasiparticles) constitutes an important yet challenging problem. Although numerical techniques can yield results for the dynamics in imaginary time, their reliable continuation to real time has proved difficult. We tackle this issue using the superfluid–insulator quantum critical point of bosons on a two-dimensional lattice, where quantum fluctuations destroy quasiparticles. We present quantum Monte Carlo simulations for two separate lattice realizations. Their low-frequency conductivities turn out to have the same universal dependence on imaginary frequency and temperature. Using the structure of the real-time dynamics of conformal field theories described by the holographic gauge/gravity duality, we then make progress on the problem of analytically continuing the numerical data to real time. Our method yields quantitative and experimentally testable results on the frequency-dependent conductivity near the quantum critical point. Extensions to other observables and universality classes are discussed.},

abstract = {In the holographic correspondence of quantum gravity, a global onsite symmetry at the boundary generally translates to a local gauge symmetry in the bulk. In this paper, we extend the tensor network based toy model for holography introduced in [arXiv:1701.04778] to incorporate this feature. We lift the multi-scale renormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of the ground state of a one dimensional (1D) local Hamiltonian, which has a global onsite symmetry, to a dual quantum state of a 2D lattice on which the symmetry appears gauged. We show how the 2D bulk state decomposes in terms of spin network states, which label a basis in the gauge-invariant sector of the bulk lattice. This decomposition is instrumental to obtain expectation values of gauge-invariant observables in the bulk, and also reveals that the bulk state is generally entangled between the gauge and the remaining bulk degrees of freedom that are not fixed by the symmetry. (In analogy with the holographic correspondence, we interpret the latter to possibly include "gravitational" degrees of freedom.) We illustrate these features for a particular subset of bulk states referred to as copy bulk states. We present numerical results for ground states of several 1D critical spin chains to illustrate that: (i) entanglement in the dual copy bulk states potentially depends on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theories, and (ii) the spectrum of a bulk density matrix, obtained by tracing out the gauge degrees of freedom, exhibits degeneracies, possibly suggesting an emergent symmetry in the non-gauge sector of the bulk. We also illustrate the possibility of emergent topological order in the bulk. More broadly, our holographic model translates the MERA, a tensor network state, to a superposition of spin network states, as they appear in lattice gauge theories in one higher dimension.},

@article{Campisi2009b,
abstract = {Based on the observation that the thermodynamic equilibrium free energy of an open quantum system in contact with a thermal environment is the difference between the free energy of the total system and that of the bare environment, the validity of the Crooks theorem and of the Jarzynski equality is extended to open quantum systems. No restrictions on the nature of the environment or on the strength of the coupling between system and environment need to be imposed. This free energy entering the Crooks theorem and the Jarzynski equality is closely related to the Hamiltonian of mean force that generalizes the classical statistical mechanical concept of the potential of mean force. Since its formulation in 1997, the classical nonequilib-rium work relation by Jarzynski [1] (now commonly referred to as the Jarzynski equality) he {\`{A}}w i ¼ e {\`{A}}{\'{A}}F (1) has continued to raise questions and concerns on its range of validity and applicability. Here, w denotes the work performed on a system when some parameters of this system are changed according to a prescribed protocol. This work is given by the difference of the energies contained in the system at the end and at the beginning of the protocol. Initially, the system is supposed to be prepared in a thermal equilibrium state at the inverse temperature. The brackets h{\'{A}}i denote a nonequilibrium average over many repetitions of this process, running under the same protocol. According to the Jarzynski equality, the average of the exponentiated negative work is independent of the details of the protocol and solely determined by the thermal equilibrium free energy difference {\'{A}}F between the initial equilibrium state and a hypothetical equilibrium state at the initial temperature and those parameter values that are reached at the end of the protocol. In the mentioned Letter [1], the validity of this equality was demonstrated within a classical statistical approach for isolated systems which initially are in the required equilibrium state at inverse temperature and also for classical systems that stay in weak contact with a thermal bath during the protocol. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of the quantum version of Eq. (1), and more generally of the Crooks fluctuation theorem [2] that underlies it; i.e., p t f ;t 0 ðþwÞ p t 0 ;t f ð{\`{A}}wÞ ¼ e ðw{\`{A}}{\'{A}}FÞ ; (2) where p t f ;t 0 ðwÞ denotes the probability density function (PDF) of work performed by the parameter changes according to a protocol running between the initial time t 0 and final time t f. The PDF of work for the reversed protocol is denoted by p t 0 ;t f ðwÞ. All these attempts refer to quantum isolated or weakly coupled systems with Hamiltonian or Markovian dynamics, respectively [3-9]. The proof of the validity of Eqs. (1) and (2) in the quantum case with weak coupling, allowing for an otherwise general non-Markovian dynamics of the open quantum dynamics and arbitrary force protocols, was provided only recently in Ref. [10]. The applicability of Eqs. (1) and (2) to the case of weak coupling is consistent with the construction of quantum and classical statistical mechanics which relies on that assumption. In striking contrast, extending the methods of statistical mechanics to cases that involve a non-negligible system-environment interaction presents a major challenge [11,12]. Addressing this question is by now becoming more and more pressing, as the advancement of technology poses us in the position to investigate experimentally the thermodynamic behavior of nanosystems operating in the quantum regime, whose reduced sizes make the system-environment coupling an important issue. A satisfactory generalization of the applicability of Eq. (1) for the classical strong coupling regime was put forward by Chris Jarzynski himself [13]; it should be stressed, however, that the objective of the corresponding quantum treatment has not been achieved yet. The key tool used in Ref. [13] to overcome the difficulties posed by the presence of strong coupling is the Hamiltonian of mean force H {\~{A}} ð{\`{A}} S ; tÞ, where {\`{A}} S denotes a point in the phase space of the subsystem of interest. This Hamiltonian of mean force is defined as the effective Hamiltonian that describes the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium of the marginal probability density of the subsystem of interest; it reads H {\~{A}} ð{\`{A}} S ; tÞ ¼ H S ð{\`{A}} S ; tÞ {\`{A}} 1 {\^{A}} ln R d{\`{A}} B exp½{\`{A}}ðH B ð{\`{A}} B Þ þ H SB ð{\`{A}} S ; {\`{A}} B ÞÞ R d{\`{A}} B expð {\`{A}} H B ð{\`{A}} B ÞÞ ; (3) where {\`{A}} B denotes a point in the phase space of the bath.},

abstract = {Modern nanofabrication techniques have opened the possi-bility to create novel functional materials, whose properties transcend those of their constituent elements. In particular, tuning the magnetostatic interactions in geometrically frus-trated arrangements of nanoelements called artificial spin ice 1,2 can lead to specific collective behaviour 3 , including emergent magnetic monopoles 4,5 , charge screening 6,7 and transport 8,9 , as well as magnonic response 10–12 . Here, we demonstrate a spin-ice-based active material in which energy is converted into unidirectional dynamics. Using X-ray photoemission electron microscopy we show that the collective rotation of the average magnetization proceeds in a unique sense during thermal relaxation. Our simulations demonstrate that this emergent chiral behaviour is driven by the topology of the magnetostatic field at the edges of the nanomagnet array, resulting in an asymmetric energy landscape. In addition, a bias field can be used to modify the sense of rotation of the average magnetization. This opens the possibility of implementing a magnetic Brownian ratchet 13,14 , which may find applications in novel nanoscale devices, such as magnetic nanomotors, actuators, sensors or memory cells. Chirality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature present in a variety of systems, from elementary particles, through the charge-parity violation of the weak interaction, to biomolecules whose function is defined by their handedness. In artificial systems, such as optical metamaterials, structural chirality can be exploited to control light–matter interactions and produce circularly polarized light 15 . In ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, the Dzyaloshinskii– Moriya interaction can give rise to chiral spin textures 16 and lead to non-reciprocal dynamics 17 . Although most studied phenomena rely on a static view of chirality, based on whether the system is superimposable on its mirror image, the definition of chirality can be extended to include electric and magnetic fields as well as dynamic properties 18 . In this context, dynamic chirality is a property of both chiral as well as achiral objects that display a preferred sense of rotation. In classical mechanics, an example is the rattleback: a spinning top that only rotates in one direction, while in chemistry, the interactions between an adsorbed molecule and a crystal surface can lead to the rotation of the molecule in a preferred direction 19 .},

abstract = {Counterdiabatic driving protocols have been proposed [Demirplak M, Rice SA (2003) J Chem Phys A 107:9937-9945; Berry M (2009) J Phys A Math Theor 42:365303] as a means to make fast changes in the Hamiltonian without exciting transitions. Such driving in principle allows one to realize arbitrarily fast annealing protocols or implement fast dissipationless driving, circumventing standard adiabatic limitations requiring infinitesimally slow rates. These ideas were tested and used both experimentally and theoretically in small systems, but in larger chaotic systems, it is known that exact counterdiabatic protocols do not exist. In this work, we develop a simple variational approach allowing one to find the best possible counterdiabatic protocols given physical constraints , like locality. These protocols are easy to derive and implement both experimentally and numerically. We show that, using these approximate protocols, one can drastically suppress heating and increase fidelity of quantum annealing protocols in complex many-particle systems. In the fast limit, these protocols provide an effective dual description of adiabatic dynamics, where the coupling constant plays the role of time and the counterdiabatic term plays the role of the Hamiltonian. counterdiabatic driving | adiabatic gauge | transitionless driving | variational principle | complex systems D espite the time-reversal symmetry of the microscopic dynamics of isolated systems, losses are ubiquitous in any process that tries to manipulate them. Whether it is the heat produced in a car engine or the decoherence of a qubit, all losses arise from our lack of control on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system. Since the early days of thermodynamics and actually, even before, the adiabatic process has emerged as a universal way to minimize losses, leading to the concept of Carnot efficiency-the cornerstone of modern thermodynamics. Despite its conceptual importance, practical implications of the Carnot efficiency are limited, because the maximal efficiency goes hand in hand with zero power. Nonetheless, by sacrificing some of the efficiency, one can run the same Carnot cycle at finite power (1). Heat engines might seem to be a problem of the past, but the understanding of finite-time thermodynamics in small (quantum) systems has become increasingly important because of developments in quantum information and nanoengineering. Developing and understanding methods to induce quasiadia-batic dynamics at finite times are paramount to the advancement of quantum information technologies. In general, one could distinguish between two (complementary) approaches. On one hand, one can, for a fixed setup, try to develop optimal driving protocols that result in minimal loss under certain constraints. Such protocols were recently suggested as appropriate geodesic paths in the parameter space in both the context of thermody-namics (2) and the context of adiabatic-state preparation (3, 4). The optimal protocols were also analyzed numerically using various optimum control ideas (5-9). On the other hand, one can try to engineer fast nonadiabatic protocols that lead to the same result as the fully adiabatic protocol. In particular, transition-less driving protocols were recently proposed and explored in small single-particle systems (10-15) with numerical extensions to larger interacting systems (16). In this approach, one introduces an auxiliary counterdiabatic (CD) Hamiltonian drive on top of a target Hamiltonian to suppress all transitions between eigenstates. A general problem with this approach is that, in complex chaotic systems, the exact CD Hamiltonian is nonlocal and exponentially sensitive to any tiny perturbations. The goal of this work is to overcome these difficulties by providing a route to finding approximate optimal CD driving protocols by restricting to a class of physical operators (e.g., those accessible in experiments). In this work, we focus specifically on local CD protocols. The ideas of CD driving are certainly not new and are used on an everyday basis in nature. Let us illustrate these ideas using an example of a waiter bringing a tray with a glass of water from the bar to a table (Fig. 1). As we will show in this work, this simple example contains very important insights, which will become relevant to the core of this paper. The goal of the waiter is to deliver the water to the table with a high fidelity (i.e., without spilling or splashing it). Of course, the glass should be vertical in the beginning of the process (i.e., when the waiter is leaving the bar) and at the end of the process (i.e., when the waiter reaches the table). The simplest protocol that can be adopted by the waiter is adia-batic, where he slowly moves along the shortest path (geodesic) connecting the bar and the table, keeping the tray vertically at all times. This protocol will work but will require a lot of time, and thus, the efficiency of such an "adiabatic waiter" will be very low. An efficient waiter has to serve more customers by going faster, and doing so requires a different tactic. When accelerating to reach a finite speed, a pseudoforce will act on the drinks, which will cause the drinks to spill or even tip over. This effect can be avoided by acting on the drinks with an equal and opposite force, which is exactly what waiters do. Moreover, the same tilt can counter a drag force caused by the air if the waiter runs very Significance Losses are ubiquitous in manipulating complex systems. They arise from our lack of control on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system. A universal way to minimize losses is to consider adiabatic processes. These processes are, however , very slow, which significantly limits their power. In this work, we show how to speed up these protocols for general complex (quantum) systems. Although dissipation cannot be avoided, we show how it can be reduced significantly with only local access to the system. Applications range from quantum information technologies to preparing experiments and even controlling complicated classical systems, such as those found in nature.},

We also present new results on hypothesis testing of correlated sources and give further evidence on the existence of NPPT bound entanglement. In the second part, we study the potential as well as the limitations of a quantum computer for calculating properties of many-body systems. First we analyse the usefulness of quantum computation to calculate additive approximations to partition functions and spectral densities of local Hamiltonians. We then show that the determination of ground state energies of local Hamiltonians with an inverse polynomial spectral gap is QCMA-hard. In the third and last part, we approach the problem of quantum simulating many-body systems from a more pragmatic point of view. We analyze the realization of paradigmatic condensed matter Hamiltonians in arrays of coupled microcavities, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models, and discuss the feasibility of an experimental realization with state-of-the-art current technology.},

abstract = {A cornerstone of the loop quantum gravity program is the fact that the phase space of general relativity on a fixed graph can be described by a product of SU(2) cotangent bundles per edge. In this paper we show how to parametrize this phase space in terms of quantities describing the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the triangulation dual to the graph. These are defined by the assignment to each face of its area, the two unit normals as seen from the two polyhedra sharing it, and an additional angle related to the extrinsic curvature. These quantities do not define a Regge geometry, since they include extrinsic data, but a looser notion of discrete geometry which is twisted in the sense that it is locally well-defined, but the local patches lack a consistent gluing among each other. We give the Poisson brackets among the new variables, and exhibit a symplectomorphism which maps them into the Poisson brackets of loop gravity. The new parametrization has the advantage of a simple description of the gauge-invariant reduced phase space, which is given by a product of phase spaces associated to edges and vertices, and it also provides an Abelianization of the SU(2) connection. The results are relevant for the construction of coherent states and, as a byproduct, contribute to clarify the connection between loop gravity and its subset corresponding to Regge geometries.},

Abstract We discuss the problem of separating consistently the total correlations in a bipartite quantum state into a quantum and a purely classical part. A measure of classical correlations is proposed and its properties are explored. PACS numbers: 03.67.−a, 03.65.Ta In quantum information theory it is common to distinguish between purely classical information, measured in bits, and quantum information, which is measured in qubits. These differ in the channel resources required to communicate them. Qubits may not be sent by a classical channel alone, but must be sent either via a quantum channel which preserves coherence or by teleportation through an entangled channel with two classical bits of communication [1]. In this context, one qubit is equivalent to one unit of shared entanglement, or 'e-bit', together with two classical bits. Any bipartite quantum state may be used as a communication channel with some degree of success, and so it is of interest to determine how to separate the correlations it contains into a classical and an entangled part. A number of measures of entanglement and of total correlations have been proposed in recent years [2–6]. However, it is still not clear how to quantify the purely classical part of the total bipartite correlations. In this paper we propose a possible measure of classical correlations and investigate its properties. We first review the existing measures of entangled and total correlations.

abstract = {We examine energy transport in an ensemble of closed quantum systems driven by stochastic perturbations. One can show that the probability and energy fluxes can be described in terms of quantum advection modes (QAMs) associated with the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. These QAMs play the role of Landauer channels in a system with discrete energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions that cannot be described as plane waves. In order to determine the type of correlations that exist between the direction and magnitudes of each QAM and the average direction of energy and probability fluxes we have numerically solved the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation describing a single particle trapped in a parabolic potential well which is perturbed by stochastic ripples. The ripples serve as a localized energy source and are offset to one side of the potential well. As the result a nonzero net energy flux flows from one part of the potential well to another across the symmetry center of the potential. We find that some modes exhibit positive correlation with the direction of the energy flow. Other modes, that carry a smaller energy per unit of the probability flux, anticorrelate with the energy flow and thus provide a backflow of the probability. The overall picture of energy transport that emerges from our results is very different from the conventional one based on a system with continuous energy spectrum.

abstract = {Invariant tensors are states in the (local) SU(2) tensor product representation but invariant under global SU(2) action. They are of importance in the study of loop quantum gravity. A random tensor is an ensemble of tensor states. An average over the ensemble is carried out when computing any physical quantities. The random tensor exhibits a phenomenon of `concentration of measure', saying that for any bipartition, the expected value of entanglement entropy of its reduced density matrix is asymptotically the maximal possible as the local dimension goes to infinity. This is also true even when the average is over the invariant subspace instead of the whole space for {\$}4-{\$}valent tensors, although its entropy deficit is divergent. One might expect that for {\$}n\backslashgeq 5{\$}, {\$}n-{\$}valent random invariant tensor would behavior similarly. However, we show that, the expected entropy deficit of reduced density matrix of such {\$}n-{\$}valent random invariant tensor from maximum, is not divergent but a finite number. Under some special situation, the number could be even smaller than half a bit, which is the deficit of random pure state over the whole Hilbert space from maximum.},

abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate the validity of nonequilibrium fluctuation relations by using a quantum coherent conductor. In equilibrium the fluctuation-dissipation relation leads to the correlation between current and current noise at the conductor, namely, the Johnson-Nyquist relation. When the conductor is voltage biased so that the nonlinear regime is entered, the fluctuation theorem has predicted similar nonequilibrium fluctuation relations, which hold true even when the Onsager-Casmir relations are broken in magnetic fields. Our experiments qualitatively validate the predictions as the first evidence of this theorem in the nonequilibrium quantum regime. The fluctuation-dissipation relation [1] is a central concept in physics. It was triggered by the description of Brownian motion by Einstein [2], who claimed that the response of a physical system to an external force is proportional to its equilibrium fluctuation. In electrical circuits this fact manifests itself as the Johnson-Nyquist (JN) relation [3,4] in such a way that the conduction through a conductor is proportional to its current noise in equilibrium. The linear response theory [5,6] founded on this relation together with the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations [7] provides a powerful tool to describe a variety of physical systems. This is, however, justified only when the systems are close to equilibrium, and the generalization to the nonequilibrium regime has been long sought. Generally the current (I) passing through a conductor can be expressed as a polynomial of the bias voltage (V) as follows: I ¼ G 1 V þ 1 2! G 2 V 2 þ 1 3! G 3 V 3 þ {\'{A}} {\'{A}} {\'{A}} ; (1) where the first term represents Ohm's law with conduc-tance G 1 (such an expansion in V is assumed to be valid for mesoscopic transport [8]). While in a mesoscopic conductor G 1 is directly related to the transmission [9], the higher-order coefficients (G 2 ; G 3 ;. . .) convey information on electron-electron interactions in a voltage biased conductor as shown recently [10-13]. Similarly to Eq. (1), a polynomial of V for the current noise power S generated in the conductor, namely, the variance of I, can be expressed as S ¼ S 0 þ S 1 V þ 1 2! S 2 V 2 þ {\'{A}} {\'{A}} {\'{A}} : (2) The coefficients of the first terms in Eqs. (1) and (2) are linked by the JN relation S 0 ¼ 4k B TG 1 , where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the conductor [3,4,14]. Now, an essential question arises: are there also correlations between the higher orders (in voltage) in current I and noise power S? Here we demonstrate a nonequilibrium fluctuation relation in a quantum coherent regime. We find a proportion-ality between S 1 and G 2 , which corresponds to the next order correlation beyond the JN relation between S 0 and G 1. The present relation is asymmetric in magnetic fields unlike the Onsager-Casimir symmetry and is valid even in the presence of interactions. Such a direct link between nonlinearity in voltage and fluctuations out-of-equilibrium has been predicted theoretically [15-19] by applying the fluctuation theorem [20] to a quantum coherent conductor. Our experiments qualitatively validate the predictions but disagree on the quantitative level. We used an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring as a typical coherent conductor. Figure 1(a) shows an atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the AB ring fabricated by local oxidation using an AFM [21] on a GaAs=AlGaAs heterostructure two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) (the electron density 3:7 {\^{A}} 10 11 cm {\`{A}}2 , the mobility 2:7 {\^{A}} 10 5 cm 2 =V s, and the electron mean free path 2:7 m at zero back-gate voltage) as well as the experimental setup for the two-terminal measurement in a dilution refrigerator. As our 2DEG has a back gate to tune the electron density, the conductance of the AB ring can be modulated by the back-gate voltage V g and the magnetic field B (the AB effect). Figure 1(b) shows the conductance as a function of V g and B, displaying clear AB oscillations with an oscillation period being 25 mT, in agreement with the ring radius of 230 nm [13].},

abstract = {Many-body localization provides a generic mechanism of ergodicity breaking in quantum systems. In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body-localized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals of motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in these systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a local particle number or a spin-flip operator), evolved with the system's Hamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such operators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL system to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents a density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes how this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely defined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for characterizing the properties of the MBL phase, in both experiments and numerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an extensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin-chain model. We show that the resulting LIOMs are quasilocal and use their decay to extract the localization length and establish the location of the transition between the MBL and ergodic phases.

abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics places constraints on state transformations. It applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can formulate laws of thermodynamics when only a small number of particles are interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are approximately cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a different form compared to the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on state transformations, but an entire family of constraints. We find a family of free energies which generalize the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. The ordinary second law relates to one of these, with the remainder imposing additional constraints on thermodynamic transitions. We find three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are relevant for small systems, and also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics are unified in this framework, with the first law defining the class of operations, the zeroth law emerging as an equivalence relation between thermal states, and the remaining laws being monotonicity of our generalized free energies.},

abstract = {We investigate the rate of thermalization of local operators in the one-dimensional anisotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with next-nearest neighbor interactions that break integrability. This is done by calculating the scaling of the difference of the diagonal and canonical thermal ensemble values as a function of system size, and by directly calculating the time evolution of the expectation values of the operators with the Chebyshev polynomial expansion. Spatial and spin symmetry is exploited and the Hamiltonian is divided into subsectors according to their symmetry. The rate of thermalization depends on the proximity to the integrable limit. When integrability is weakly broken thermalization is slow, and becomes faster the stronger the next-nearest neighbor interaction is. Three different regimes for the rate of thermalization with respect to the strength of the integrability breaking parameter are identified. These are shown to be directly connected with the relative strength of the low and higher energy difference off-diagonal operator matrix elements in the symmetry eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian. Close to the integrable limit the off-diagonal matrix elements peak at higher energies and high-frequency fluctuations are important and slow down thermalization. Away from the integrable limit a strong low-energy peak gradually develops that takes over the higher frequency fluctuations and leads to quicker thermalization.},

abstract = {A generalized fluctuation-response relation is found for thermal systems driven out of equilibrium. Its derivation is independent of many details of the dynamics, which is only required to be first order. The result gives a correction to the equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem, in terms of the correlation between observable and excess in dynamical activity caused by the perturbation. Previous approaches to this problem are recovered and extended in a unifying scheme. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a standard chapter in statistical mechanics [1-3]. A system in thermal equilibrium has statistical fluctuations proportional to its response to external perturbations: a small impulse changing the potential U ! U {\`{A}} h s V at time s will produce a response R eq QV ðt; sÞ ¼ hQðtÞi=h s in a quantity Q at time t ! s of the form R eq QV ðt; sÞ ¼ d ds hVðsÞQðtÞi eq ; (1) where hVðsÞQðtÞi eq is a correlation function quantifying the equilibrium fluctuations in absence of any perturbation, and the proportionality constant ¼ 1=k B T is the inverse temperature. An early example of this theorem is present in Einstein's treatment of Brownian motion, where the diffusion constant, expressed as a velocity autocorrelation function , is found proportional to the mobility. Other famous examples include the Johnson-Nyquist formula for electronic white noise and the Onsager reciprocity for linear response coefficients. So far, approaches deriving a fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) for nonequilibrium [4-13] have not found a physical unification and do not appear as textbook material. One reason may be that previous work has not been seen to identify a sufficiently general structure with a clear corresponding statistical thermodynamic interpretation. Today, such an interpretation has become available from advances in dynamical fluctuation theory for nonequilib-rium systems. Aiming to provide a simple and general approach to FDRs, in this Letter we put forward a FDR for nonequi-librium regimes in a framework that may represent a unifying scheme for previous formulations. Our main result can be found in a general formula, Eq. (6) below, which can also sometimes be rewritten as (7) or (11). In order to go beyond equilibrium and beyond formal perturbation theory, it is important to recognize in the right-hand side of (1) the role of entropy production, as usual governing close-to-equilibrium considerations. Equation (1) expresses the correlation between the dissi-pation represented by entropy production (energy change divided by temperature) and the observable QðtÞ. Here, for perturbations of a nonequilibrium system (that already has a nonvanishing set of flows and hence a nonzero entropy production), we will rather speak of the excess of entropy produced by the perturbation h s V. The second ingredient that is essential in nonequilibrium is still a less known quantity, called traffic [14] or dynami-cal activity [15], first introduced in [16]. Perhaps activity has been somewhat overlooked in the past because it plays a truly significant role only beyond linear order around equilibrium [14,17], and it is not part of the picture in standard irreversible thermodynamics. Our present results will in fact further clarify the relevance of dynamical activity. To get a first idea of its meaning, we note that activity often measures the frequency of transitions in a trajectory: this is a time-symmetric aspect of dynamical fluctuations [16] because it does not depend on the direction chosen to span the trajectory. On the other hand, it is well known that entropy production is time antisymmetric [18], changing sign upon reversal of time (fluxes are inverted if time is run backward). Thus, both quantities arise naturally as two complementary pieces of the space-time action, as reminded below. We consider a system in an environment at inverse temperature (with k B ¼ 1), where a time-independent nonequilibrium condition can be imposed by external driving fields or by installing mechanical displacements or chemical gradients at the boundaries of the system. Moreover, the system evolves according to a Markovian/ first-order dynamics: for any two observables f and g, their correlations at times s {\textless} t satisfy d dt hfðx t Þgðx s Þi ¼ hðLfÞðx t Þgðx s Þi where L is a linear operator, called a generator , acting on observables, and x t is the state at time t at some reduced, e.g., mesoscopic level of description: e tL fðxÞ ¼ hfðx t Þjx 0 ¼ xi, t ! 0 [in the sequel we abbreviate fðx t Þ ¼ fðtÞ]. The generator L is a standard tool: for jump processes it is the matrix with transition rates as off-diagonal elements, while L ¼ ðforceÞ {\'{A}} r þ {\'{A}}= for over-damped diffusions. However, it is our aim to leave the generator L as unspecified as possible, to emphasize the PRL 103, 010602 (2009) P H Y S I C A L},

We bring it closer to the perspective of area-angle Regge calculus and twisted geometries, and compute explicitly the Hessian and phase offsets. We then extend it to more general SU(2) graph invariants, showing that saddle points still exist and have a similar structure. For graphs dual to 4d polytopes we find again two distinct saddle points leading to a cosine asymptotic formula, however a conformal shape-mismatch is allowed by these configurations, and the asymptotic action is thus a generalisation of the Regge action. The allowed mismatch correspond to angle-matched twisted geometries, 3d polyhedral tessellations with adjacent faces matching areas and 2d angles, but not their diagonals. We study these geometries, identify the relevant subsets corresponding to 3d Regge data and flat polytope data, and discuss the corresponding Regge actions emerging in the asymptotics. Finally, we also provide the first numerical confirmation of the large spin asymptotics of the 15j symbol. We show that the agreement is accurate to the per cent level already at spins of order 10, and the next-to-leading order oscillates with the same frequency and same global phase.},

We start by deriving multipartite Bell inequalities involving an arbitrary number of measurement settings, two outcomes per party and one-and two-body correlators only. Based on these inequalities, we then build up improved witnesses able to detect Bell correlated states in many-body systems using two collective measurements only. These witnesses can potentially detect Bell correlations in states with an arbitrarily low amount of spin squeezing. We then establish an upper bound on the statistics needed to convincingly conclude that a measured state is Bell correlated.},

Here we only consider a single system and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable under a weaker form of reversibility. Indeed, we show that given a single copy of any athermal quantum state, an optimal amount of energy can be extracted from it when we utilise a machine that operates in a reversible cycle. This means that for individual systems, the only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is complete passivity, and thus provides a physically motivated identification of thermal states when we are not operating in the thermodynamic limit.},

We also describe an orthonormal basis of spin network states associated to any fixed graph ,.

abstract = {We discuss how a lattice Schwinger model can be realized in a linear ion trap, allowing a detailed study of the physics of Abelian lattice gauge theories related to one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Relying on the rich quantum-simulation toolbox available in state-of-the-art trapped-ion experiments, we show how one can engineer an effectively gauge-invariant dynamics by imposing energetic constraints, provided by strong Ising-like interactions. Applying exact diagonalization to ground-state and time-dependent properties, we study the underlying microscopic model and discuss undesired interaction terms and other imperfections. As our analysis shows, the proposed scheme allows for the observation in realistic setups of spontaneous parity-and charge-symmetry breaking, as well as false-vacuum decay. Besides an implementation aimed at larger ion chains, we also discuss a minimal setting, consisting of only four ions in a simpler experimental setup, which enables us to probe basic physical phenomena related to the full many-body problem. The proposal opens a new route for analog quantum simulation of high-energy and condensed-matter models where gauge symmetries play a prominent role.},

abstract = {Black holes have many faces. Arguably, they are the most interesting objects in theoretical physics, revealing the elusive connection between gravity and quantum mechanics. Within the gauge/string duality they provide useful insights on strongly coupled quantum field theories and on quantum gravity. Furthermore, probing the strong curvature regime of any grav- ity theory, black holes carry the imprint of possible strong curvature corrections to General Relativity. Finally, beside their unique theoretical properties, several experimental evidences suggest that astrophysical black holes exist in nature and they are believed to be very com- mon objects in the universe. In this dissertation we discuss several applications of linear perturbation theory in black hole physics. As applications in theoretical physics, we study perturbations of dilatonic black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory and the holographic prop- erties of the dual field theory via the Anti de Sitter/Condensed Matter duality. Furthermore we discuss a method to compute long-lived quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-Anti de Sit- ter black holes and we study vortex black hole solutions in three dimensional Anti de Sitter gravity. As applications in astrophysics, we discuss how the characteristic oscillations of black holes in string-inspired theories of gravity can provide observable signatures of deviations from General Relativity. We study two well-motivated effective theories: Dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and Einstein-Dilatonic-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We conclude by discussing the black hole paradigm. Motivated by the lacking of a definitive answer on the existence of astrophysi- cal black holes, we study some viable alternatives, generally called “black hole mimickers”. We focus on two representative cases: static thin-shell gravastars and superspinars. We discuss their stability, gravitational-wave signature and viability as astrophysical objects.},

abstract = {The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula relates the entanglement entropy of a region in a holographic theory to the area of a corresponding bulk minimal surface. Using the max flow-min cut principle, a theorem from network theory, we rewrite the RT formula in a way that does not make reference to the minimal surface. Instead, we invoke the notion of a "flow", defined as a divergenceless norm-bounded vector field, or equivalently a set of Planck-thickness "bit threads". The entanglement entropy of a boundary region is given by the maximum flux out of it of any flow, or equivalently the maximum number of bit threads that can emanate from it. The threads thus represent entanglement between points on the boundary, and naturally implement the holographic principle. As we explain, this new picture clarifies several conceptual puzzles surrounding the RT formula. We give flow-based proofs of strong subadditivity and related properties; unlike the ones based on minimal surfaces, these proofs correspond in a transparent manner to the properties' information-theoretic meanings. We also briefly discuss certain technical advantages that the flows offer over minimal surfaces. In a mathematical appendix, we review the max flow-min cut theorem on networks and on Riemannian manifolds, and prove in the network case that the set of max flows varies Lipshitz continuously in the network parameters.},

Livine -This content was downloaded from IP address 168.150.49.150 on 23/03/2018 at 19:31 Abstract In the context of loop quantum gravity, quantum states of geometry are mathematically defined as spin networks living on graphs embedded in the canonical space-like hypersurface. In the effort to study the renormalization flow of loop gravity, a necessary step is to understand the coarse-graining of these states in order to describe their relevant structure at various scales. Using the spinor network formalism to describe the phase space of loop gravity on a given graph, we focus on a bounded (connected) region of the graph and coarse-grain it to a single vertex using a gauge-fixing procedure. We discuss the ambiguities in the gauge-fixing procedure and its consequences for coarse-graining spin(or) networks. This allows to define the boundary deformations of that region in a gauge-invariant fashion and to identify the area preserving deformations as U(N) transformations similarly to the already well-studied case of a single intertwiner. The novelty is that the closure constraint is now relaxed and the closure defect interpreted as a local measure of the curvature inside the coarse-grained region. It is nevertheless possible to cancel the closure defect by a Lorentz boost. We further identify a Lorentz-invariant observable related to the area and closure defect, which we name 'rest area'. Its physical meaning remains an open issue.},

abstract = {Quantum fluctuations relations are typically derived with projective measurements of energy at the beginning and the end of the protocol. Though projective measurements are easy to treat theoretically, they may be difficult to implement in experiments. We show that recent results on the force protocol with generalized measurements remain valid with more general forms of quantum evolution. In the case considered, states of an open quantum system are transformed according to an arbitrary trace-preserving completely positive map. The energy measurements used in the protocol are prescribed as a superposition of projec-tive ones. Such measurements can be parameterized by a continuous variable substituted into acceptance functions of the apparatuses. The role of limited measurement precision is also clarified here. As is known, the standard Jarzynski equality and the Tasaki-Crooks theorem remain valid for the case of unital quantum channels. Using characteristic functions, we recast standard relations for the scenario with generalized measurements. With respect to the Jarzynski equality, generalized measurements lead to a negative shift in observed values of the difference of free energies. A deviation of the actual quantum channel from unital ones may also generate some shift with an arbitrary sign.},

We show that this relation holds not only for the long-time limit of fluctuations, as described by large deviation theory, but also for fluctuations on arbitrary finite time scales. This generalization facilitates applying the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to single molecule experiments, for which infinite time scales are not accessible. Importantly, often this finite-time variant of the relation allows inferring a bound on the entropy production that is even stronger than the one obtained from the long-time limit. We illustrate the relation for the fluctuating work that is performed by a stochastically switching laser tweezer on a trapped colloidal particle.},

abstract = {A pure quantum state can fully describe thermal equilibrium as long as one focuses on local observables. The thermodynamic entropy can also be recovered as the entanglement entropy of small subsystems. When the size of the subsystem increases, however, quantum correlations break the correspondence and mandate a correction to this simple volume law. The elucidation of the size dependence of the entanglement entropy is thus essentially important in linking quantum physics with thermodynamics. Here we derive an analytic formula of the entanglement entropy for a class of pure states called cTPQ states representing equilibrium. We numerically find that our formula applies universally to any sufficiently scrambled pure state representing thermal equilibrium, i.e., energy eigenstates of non-integrable models and states after quantum quenches. Our formula is exploited as diagnostics for chaotic systems; it can distinguish integrable models from non-integrable models and many-body localization phases from chaotic phases.

This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration.

abstract = {The Renyi entropies and entanglement entropy of 1+1 CFTs with gravity duals can be computed by explicit construction of the bulk spacetimes dual to branched covers of the boundary geometry. At the classical level in the bulk this has recently been shown to reproduce the conjectured Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the holographic entanglement entropy. We study the one-loop bulk corrections to this formula. The functional determinants in the bulk geometries are given by a sum over certain words of generators of the Schottky group of the branched cover. For the case of two disjoint intervals on a line we obtain analytic answers for the one-loop entanglement entropy in an expansion in small cross-ratio. These reproduce and go beyond anticipated universal terms that are not visible classically in the bulk. We also consider the case of a single interval on a circle at finite temperature. At high temperatures we show that the one-loop contributions introduce expected finite size corrections to the entanglement entropy that are not present classically. At low temperatures, the one-loop corrections capture the mixed nature of the density matrix, also not visible classically below the Hawking-Page temperature.},

abstract = {Generalized measurements of an observable performed on a quantum system during a force protocol are investigated and conditions that guarantee the validity of the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation are formulated. In agreement with previous studies by M. Campisi, P. Talkner, and P. H{\"{a}}nggi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 140601 (2010); Phys. Rev. E 83, 041114 (2011)], we find that these fluctuation relations are satisfied for projective measurements; however, for generalized measurements special conditions on the operators determining the measurements need to be met. For the Jarzynski equality to hold, the measurement operators of the forward protocol must be normalized in a particular way. The Crooks relation additionally entails that the backward and forward measurement operators depend on each other. Yet, quite some freedom is left as to how the two sets of operators are interrelated. This ambiguity is removed if one considers selective measurements, which are specified by a joint probability density function of work and measurement results of the considered observable. We find that the respective forward and backward joint probabilities satisfy the Crooks relation only if the measurement operators of the forward and backward protocols are the time-reversed adjoints of each other. In this case, the work probability density function conditioned on the measurement result satisfies a modified Crooks relation. The modification appears as a protocol-dependent factor that can be expressed by the information gained by the measurements during the forward and backward protocols. Finally, detailed fluctuation theorems with an arbitrary number of intervening measurements are obtained.},

abstract = {We study the collisional processes that can lead to thermalization in one-dimensional (1D) systems. For two-body collisions, excitations of transverse modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalization. At very low temperatures, excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed, thermalization by two-body collisions stops and the system should become integrable. In quantum mechanics, virtual excitations of higher radial modes are possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective three-body velocity-changing collisions, which lead to thermalization. We show that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative momentum k is small compared with the two-body coupling constant c, the three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of (k/c) 12 , which is proportional to $\gamma$ −12 , that is, to the square of the three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the Lieb–Liniger parameter $\gamma$ 1. This demonstrates that in 1D quantum systems, it is not the freeze-out of two-body collisions but the strong quantum correlations that ensure absence of thermalization on experimentally relevant time scales.},

@article{Burrell,
abstract = {We investigate the propagation of information through the disordered XY model. We find that all correlations, both classical and quantum, are exponentially suppressed outside of an effective light cone whose radius grows at most logarithmically with jtj. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.167201 PACS numbers: 75.10.Pq, 03.67.{\"{y}}a, 72.15.Rn, 75.40.Mg How fast can information propagate through a locally interacting system? For classical systems an essentially universal answer to this question is that the velocity of information propagation is bounded (often only approxi-mately) by an effective speed of light. It is a more subtle issue to formulate equivalent velocity bounds for quantum systems because they can encode quantum information in the form of qubits and therefore might be able to exploit quantum interference to propagate information faster. However, for quantum spin networks this is not the case: the Lieb-Robinson bound limits the velocity at which correlations can propagate [1]. The Lieb-Robinson bound implies that there is an effec-tive light cone for two-point dynamical correlations; i.e., apart from an exponentially suppressed tail, two-point correlations propagate no faster than the speed of light. Simplified and alternative proofs of the Lieb-Robinson bound have been subsequently discovered [2 –5]. More recently, it has been realized that the Lieb-Robinson bound is strong enough to bound not only the propagation of two-point correlations but of any local encoding of information [6] (see also Refs. [7–10]). There are many consequences of the Lieb-Robinson bound. Apart from the aforementioned bounds on the velocity of information propagation, it has been realized that the Lieb-Robinson bound can be used to provide a method to efficiently simulate the properties of low-dimensional spin networks [11–15]. Additionally, using the Lieb-Robinson bound, dynamical entropy area laws for quantum spin systems can be obtained [6,16]. While the Lieb-Robinson bound is extremely general — it relies only on the ultraviolet cutoff imposed by lattice structure —it is, as a consequence, relatively weak. Thus, it is extremely desirable to develop stronger bounds con-straining the propagation of quantum information through systems where more is known about the structure of the interactions. One setting where one would expect stronger bounds to be available is when the system has disordered interactions. This is because they can exhibit the striking phenomenon of Anderson localization [17], which means that information is essentially frozen: a quantum particle placed anywhere within a localized system diffuses only slightly, even for extremely large times. Thus, exploiting the parallels between bounds on information propagation and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we are motivated to conjecture that interacting spin systems with disordered interactions satisfy stronger bounds on correlation propagation (see Fig. 1). More specifically, we conjecture that for quantum spin networks with disordered interactions all correlations, both quantum and classical, are suppressed outside of a light cone whose radius grows at most logarithmically in time. (Contrast this with the light cone supplied by the Lieb-Robinson bound: it has a radius which grows linearly with time.) In this Letter we study a setting where the dynamics of a class of disordered interacting spin systems can be shown to satisfy our logarithmic light cone conjecture; we study the XY spin chain with disordered interactions in a disor-dered magnetic field and show that information, and hence correlations, are exponentially attenuated outside of a light cone whose radius grows logarithmically with time. The main result of this Letter, the logarithmic light cone for the disordered XY model, can by summarized by the following bound on the dynamic two-point correlation functions: kA j ; e itH B k e {\"{y}}itH k cn 2 jtje {\"{y}}vjj{\"{y}}kj=l max ; (1)},

abstract = {Free-energy-landscape formalisms provide the fundamental conceptual framework for physical descriptions of how proteins and nucleic acids fold into specific three-dimensional structures 1,2. Although folding landscapes are difficult to measure experimentally, recent theoretical work by Hummer and Szabo 3 has shown that landscape profiles can be reconstructed from non-equilibrium single-molecule force spec-troscopy measurements using an extension of the Jarzynski equality 4. This method has been applied to simulations 5,6 and experiments 7,8 but never validated experimentally. We tested it using force-extension measurements on DNA hairpins with distinct, sequence-dependent folding landscapes. Quantitative agreement was found between the landscape profiles obtained from the non-equilibrium reconstruction and those from equilibrium probability distributions 9. We also tested the method on a riboswitch aptamer with three partially folded intermediate states, successfully reconstructing the landscape but finding some states difficult to resolve owing to low occupancy or overlap of the potential wells. These measurements validate the landscape-reconstruction method and provide a new test of non-equilibrium work relations. Folding-landscape formalisms have broad applications in bio-physics, from improving predictive structural models and protein engineering 10,11 to providing crucial insights into biomolecular structure, dynamics, function and disease 12,13. Specific characteristics of folding landscapes, such as the roughness of the free-energy surface 14 or the properties of partially folded intermediate 15 and transition states 16 , including how they are altered by temperature changes, solvent substitutions or mutations 17 , have been widely studied by experiment and theory. However, it has proven remarkably challenging to go beyond such isolated features and measure the entire profile of the free-energy landscape along the reaction coordinate. Single-molecule force spectroscopy provides a unique window into folding reactions because of its ability to measure properties of the free-energy landscape. In single-molecule force spectroscopy, a single molecule is held under mechanical tension by a spring-like force probe such as an optical trap or atomic force microscope, and the end-to-end extension of the molecule is recorded while the molecule folds/unfolds under the influence of the denaturing force (Fig. 1a). By this means, the folding energies and rates, partially folded intermediates and similar characteristics may be explored 18. Measurements can be made either in the equilibrium regime (for example, by maintaining a constant force using an active 19 a b 5 kJ mol ¬1 Figure 1 | Optical-trapping measurements. a, Schematic representation of hairpin construct in optical trap. z(t) represents the time-dependent trap separation, q(t) the molecular extension. b, Measurements of extension at constant force can be used to generate extension probability distributions and hence the energy-landscape profile. Illustrated here for hairpin A. or passive 20 force clamp) or in the non-equilibrium regime (for example, by ramping the force rapidly 7). A method for determining the free-energy profile using equilibrium measurements (Fig. 1b) was recently validated through quantitative comparisons of the landscape profiles measured for different DNA hairpin sequences to a parameter-free model of the sequence-dependent landscapes 9. This method is accurate and has also been applied to measure protein-folding landscapes 21 , but it is technically demanding, requiring very high spatiotemporal resolution and stability. Equilibrium thermodynamic properties can also be extracted from non-equilibrium measurements such as force-ramp experiments. Although work is irreversibly dissipated in such measurements , the equilibrium free energy can be reconstructed from the distribution of the non-equilibrium work using fluctuation theorems such as the Jarzynski equality 4 or the Crooks fluctuation theorem 22. These methods have been tested through nanome-chanical measurements of unfolding transitions in single RNA hairpins 7,23 and applied widely 24.

abstract = {We consider entanglement entropy between regions of space in lattice gauge theory. The Hilbert space corresponding to a region of space includes edge states that transform nontrivially under gauge transformations. By decomposing the edge states in irreducible representations of the gauge group, the entropy of an arbitrary state is expressed as the sum of three positive terms: a term associated with the classical Shannon entropy of the distribution of boundary representations, a term that appears only for non-Abelian gauge theories and depends on the dimension of the boundary representations, and a term representing nonlocal correlations. The first two terms are the entropy of the edge states, and depend only on observables measurable at the boundary. These results are applied to several examples of lattice gauge theory states, including the ground state in the strong coupling expansion of Kogut and Susskind. In all these examples we find that the entropy of the edge states is the dominant contribution to the entanglement entropy.},

abstract = {Whilst resonant transmission is well understood and can be fully harnessed for crystalline superlattices, a complete picture has not yet emerged for disordered superlattices. It has proven difficult to tune resonant transmission in disordered diamond-like carbon (DLC) superlattices as conventional models are not equipped to incorporate significant structural disorder. In this work, we present concurrent experimental and theoretical analysis which addresses resonant transmission in DLC superlattices. Devices were fabricated by growing alternate layers of DLC with different percentages of sp 3 hybridized carbon.Coherent quantum transport effects were demonstrated in these structurally disordered DLC superlattices through distinct current modulation with negative differential resistance (NDR) in the current-voltage (I-V) measurements. A model was developed using tight-binding calculations assuming a random variation of the hopping integral to simulate structural (bond-length) disorder. Calculations of the I-V characteristics compliment the interpretation of the measurements and illustrate that while DLC superlattice structures are unlike their classical counterparts, the near-field structural order will help with the confinement of quantised states. The present model provides an empirical guide for tailoring the properties of future devices, giving rise to much hope that carbon electronics operating at high frequencies over large areas can now be developed. Amorphous superlattices, known to be advantageous in overcoming the lattice mismatch problems of crystalline semiconductors, have long been studied towards developing high-speed oscillators and detectors},

These geometric phases have profound impacts in both quantum and classical physics. In addition to the geometric phase associated with band structures in reciprocal space that has led to the discovery of topological insulators, the spin-redirection geometric phase induced by the SO (3) rotation of states in real space can also give rise to intriguing phenomena such as the photonic analog of the spin Hall effect. By exploiting the orbital angular momentum of sound vortices, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the spin-redirection geometric phase effects in airborne sound, which is a scalar wave without spin. We show that these effects, associated with the helical transport of sound, can be used to control the flow of sound. This finding opens new possibilities for the manipulation of scalar wave propagation by exploiting spin-redirection geometric phases.},

We discuss in detail the case of the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field. We show that this model displays a continuum of full counting statistics transitions, of which the static transition is just an end point. These singularities are not a consequence of particular choices of initial conditions or other external nonequilibrium protocols such as quenches in coupling constants. They can be probed generically through quantum jump statistics of an associated open problem, and for the case of the quantum Ising chain we outline a possible experimental realization of this scheme by digital quantum simulation with cold ions.},

In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, if the original state has a dual bulk spacetime with a good classical description, it is natural to ask how much information about the bulk spacetime is carried by the density matrix for such a subset of field theory degrees of freedom. In this note, we provide several constraints on the largest region that can be fully reconstructed, and discuss specific proposals for the geometric construction of this dual region.},

abstract = {Quantum state tomography via local measurements is an efficient tool for characterizing quantum states. However, it requires that the original global state be uniquely determined (UD) by its local reduced density matrices (RDMs). In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a class of states that are UD by their RDMs under the assumption that the global state is pure, but fail to be UD in the absence of that assumption. This discovery allows us to classify quantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each class be treated distinctly in the practice of simplifying quantum state tomography. Additionally, we experimentally test the feasibility and stability of performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for each class. These theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the advantages and possible pitfalls of quantum state tomography with local measurements. Introduction.—Quantum state tomography (QST) is one of the most famous double-edged swords in quantum information science. On the one hand, QST provides a complete description of an arbitrary quantum state, which is essential for benchmarking and validating quantum devices [1–5]. On the other hand, the exponential resources QST requires make scaling it to large systems infeasible in practice. In the past decade, tremendous effort has been devoted to boosting the efficiency of QST [6–12]. QST via reduced density matrices (RDMs) [13–18] is one especially promising approach, as it is significantly less resource intensive and many experimental setups are able to perform local measurements conveniently and accurately. One criterion for adopting this approach is that the global state has to be the only state which is compatible with its RDMs; that is, it must be uniquely determined (UD) by its RDMs. The UD criterion can be further classified into two categories: uniquely determined among all states (UDA) and uniquely determined among pure states (UDP) by local RDMs. (In this work, UD refers to UD by its RDMs unless otherwise specified. For the background of UD via general measurements, see Appendix A in Ref. [19] for more details.) The quantum states of many physically realistic quantum systems usually belong to the UDA category. These systems involve only few-body interactions [24] and possess ground states which exhibit special properties [25–28]. To reconstruct states of this type, experimentalists need only measure RDMs and search for the global state which is compatible with these RDMs. This saves an exponential number of measurements [29]. In the case of states which satisfy the UDP criterion, two assumptions must be made if one wishes to reconstruct such states via RDMs. First, the experimentally prepared states must be (nearly) pure. Second, the search space of possible reconstructions must be limited to pure states; otherwise, the searching procedure may return incorrect mixed states with the same RDMs. Despite these assumptions, searching for UDP states has the advantage of significantly reducing the number of search parameters since the search space is pure. Traditionally, this has been the approach for dealing with many related problems, for instance, the famous Pauli problem and its finite dimensional versions [30,31]. In this Letter, we resolve the relation between the UDP and UDA criteria, and it is shown that there are states that are UDP but not UDA. Therefore, one should classify many-body quantum states into three different nontrivial classes: (A) neither UDP nor UDA, (B) UDA, or (C) UDP but not UDA. One may argue that the existence of states of class C is trivial as the set of pure states is of a much lower dimension then that of the mixed states. We emphasize, however, that this is not the case: when constructing examples of states of class C, one is working with pure},

abstract = {The project concerns the study of the interplay among quantum mechanics, sta- tistical mechanics and thermodynamics, in isolated quantum systems. The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the concept of thermal equilibrium in quantum systems. First, I investigated the role played by observables and measurements in the emer- gence of thermal behaviour. This led to a new notion of thermal equilibrium which is specific for a given observable, rather than for the whole state of the system. The equilibrium picture that emerges is a generalization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested in the state of the system but only in the outcome of the mea- surement process. I investigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches for the emergence of thermal behaviour in quantum systems: the Eigen- state Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study the equilibrium properties of peculiar quantum systems, which are known to escape thermalization: the many-body localised systems. Despite the localization phenomenon, which pre- vents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show that we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the equilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the process led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the interacting nature of many-body localised systems. Then, I exploited the “Concentration of Measure” and the related “Typicality Ar- guments” to study the macroscopic properties of the basis states in a tentative theory of quantum gravity: Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used to explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous phenomenon at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their ther- modynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to give a quantum description of a black hole which is consis- tent with the expected semiclassical behaviour. This was motivated by the necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective, how and why an horizon exhibits thermal properties.},

The quantum Ricci curvature is designed for use on non-smooth and discrete metric spaces, and to satisfy the key criteria of scalability and computability. We test the prescription on a variety of regular and random piecewise flat spaces, mostly in two dimensions. This enables us to quantify its behaviour for short lattices distances and compare its large-scale behaviour with that of constantly curved model spaces.

Within this approach we identify a many-body localized state of the chain as a dynamical infinite randomness fixed point. Near this fixed point our method becomes asymptotically exact, allowing analytic calculation of time dependent quantities. In particular, we explain the striking universal features in the growth of the entanglement seen in recent numerical simulations: unbounded logarithmic growth delayed by a time inversely proportional to the interaction strength. This is in striking contrast to the much slower entropy growth as loglogt found for noninteracting fermions with bond disorder. Nonetheless, even the interacting system does not thermalize in the long time limit. We attribute this to an infinite set of approximate integrals of motion revealed in the course of the RG flow, which become asymptotically exact conservation laws at the fixed point. Hence we identify the many-body localized state with an emergent generalized Gibbs ensemble.},

abstract = {Spin networks are a natural generalization of Wilson loop functionals. They have been extensively studied in the case where the gauge group is compact and it has been shown that they naturally form a basis of gauge invariant observables. Physi-cally the restriction to compact gauge groups is enough for the study of Yang–Mills theories, however it is well known that noncompact groups naturally arise as inter-nal gauge groups for Lorentzian gravity models. In this context, a proper construc-tion of gauge invariant observables is needed. The purpose of the present work is to define the notion of spin network states for noncompact groups. We first build, by a careful gauge fixing procedure, a natural measure and a Hilbert space structure on the space of gauge invariant graph connections. Spin networks are then defined as generalized eigenvectors of a complete set of hermitic commuting operators. We show how the delicate issue of taking the quotient of a space by noncompact groups can be address in term of algebraic geometry. We finally construct the full Hilbert space containing all spin network states. Having in mind applications to gravity, we illustrate our results for the groups SL͑2,R͒ and SL͑2,C͒.},

Many-body localized (MBL) phases limit the spread of this coherence and appear promising for quantum information applications. However, such applications require not just long coherence times but also a means to transport and manipulate information. We demonstrate that this can be done in a one dimensional model of interacting spins at infinite temperature. Our protocol utilizes protected qubits which emerge at the boundary between topological and trivial phases. State transfer occurs via dynamic shifts of this boundary and is shown to preserve quantum information. As an example, we discuss the implementation of a universal, two-qubit gate based upon MBL-protected quantum state transfer.},

abstract = {We present a general information theoretic approach for identifying functional subgraphs in complex networks. We show that the uncertainty in a variable can be written as a sum of information quantities, where each term is generated by successively conditioning mutual informations on new measured variables in a way analogous to a discrete differential calculus. The analogy to a Taylor series suggests efficient optimization algorithms for determining the state of a target variable in terms of functional groups of other nodes. We apply this methodology to electrophysiological recordings of cortical neuronal networks grown in vitro. Each cell's firing is generally explained by the activity of a few neurons. We identify these neuronal subgraphs in terms of their redundant or synergetic character and reconstruct neuronal circuits that account for the state of target cells. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.238701 PACS numbers: 89.75.Hc, 05.45.Tp, 84.35.+i, 87.18.Sn Information plays a central role in conditioning structure and determining collective dynamics in many complex systems. For example, the ability to process and react to information certainly influences how neurons and synap-ses, or genes and proteins, interact in large numbers to generate the complexity of cognitive and biological pro-cesses. Despite their importance, however, systematic methodologies for identifying functional relations between units of successive complexity, involved in information processing and storage, are still largely missing. Motivated by recent theoretical developments and ex-perimental breakthroughs, new interest has arisen in appli-cations of information theory to dynamical and statistical systems with many degrees of freedom [1]. Specifically, it has been shown that information quantities can identify and classify spatial [2] and temporal [3] correlations and reveal if a group of variables may be mutually redundant or synergetic [4,5]. In this way, an information theoretic treat-ment of groups of correlated degrees of freedom can reveal their functional roles as memory structures or those ca-pable of processing information. The application of these insights to identify functional connectivity structure is still just beginning [5] but should provide a useful complement to other established ap-proaches [6] by directly relating observable dynamics or statistics to information structures. To date, the identifica-tion of functional relations between nodes of a complex network has relied on the statistics of motifs. These are specific (directed) subgraphs of k nodes that appear more abundantly than expected in randomized networks with the same number of nodes and degree of connectivity [6,7]. Although powerful for small subgraphs, this approach scales up poorly since the number of different subgraphs explodes combinatorially with increasing number of nodes k. Consequently, the extensive searches that are necessary for measuring motif frequencies become prohibitive be-yond about k 5. A general solution to this curse of dimensionality is to perform targeted searches guided by quantitative expectations for finding the most informative node combinations relative to an external signal or to other parts of the system. Here, we present an approach based on the rigorous properties of information theory applied to the correlated statistical state of many variables. The uncertainty (Shannon entropy) in the state of any target variable can be expressed in terms of a cluster expansion of information quantities involving a successively larger number of vari-ables. The sign and magnitude of each term in the expan-sion determines the functional connectivity among nodes to that order, specifically whether a set of nodes is func-tionally independent, redundant, or synergetic. Because the Shannon entropy is positive definite, this expansion gives a systematic approximation to the state of the target; the expansion can be truncated at any order to construct ap-proximate nonexhaustive search algorithms, analogous to gradient methods in other optimization problems. We dem-onstrate the efficacy of this method through its application to spike time series of cortical neuronal networks grown in vitro. Information is a relative quantity, quantifying the reduc-tion in uncertainty of a variable's statistical state given knowledge of others with which it is correlated. The un-certainty in the state of X can be quantified by its Shannon entropy [8] S X  {\"{y}} P x p xlog 2 p x, where p x are the marginals for each state x of X. Note that S X 0, where S X  0 corresponds to precise knowledge of X and the probability distribution p x  1 for some state x. Measuring correlated variables Y i to X contributes to knowledge of its state and reduces its uncertainty; thus, S X S XjfYg k{\"{y}}1  S XjfYg k , with k n for n total variables and where S XjY refers to the conditional en-tropy of X given Y [8]. We use the notation fYg k to refer to the set Y 1 ; . . . ; Y k . The difference between the entropy of X and its entropy given the joint state of a set fYg k is the information in the set: I X; fYg k   S X {\"{y}} S XjfYg k  I X; fYg k{\"{y}}1 . These relations also specify the optimization},

abstract = {The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds with basic principles in quantum mechanics. Statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an isolated many-body system initialized in a pure state will remain pure during Schr$\backslash$"{\{}o{\}}dinger evolution, and in this sense has static, zero entropy. The underlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly antithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of systems. Here we experimentally study the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state, and observe the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. We perform microscopy on an evolving quantum system, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. Although the full state remains measurably pure, entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a near-volume law in the entanglement entropy.},

This problem is relevant for the study of localized quantum information in gravity since the set of approximately-local operators in a region may not be closed under arbitrary products. While we cannot naturally associate a density matrix with a state in this setting, it is still possible to define a modular operator for a state, and distinguish between two states using a relative modular operator. These operators are defined on a little Hilbert space, which parameterizes small deformations of the system away from its original state, and they do not depend on the structure of the full Hilbert space of the theory. We extract a class of relative-entropy-like quantities from the spectrum of these operators that measure the distance between states, are monotonic under contractions of the set of available observables, and vanish only when the states are equal. Consequently, these distance-measures can be used to define measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We describe applications of our measures to coarse-grained and fine-grained subregion dualities in AdS/CFT and provide a few sample calculations to illustrate our formalism.},

Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal of developing large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor: a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales.

abstract = {We report the first experimental observation of the time-driven phase transition in a canonical quantum chaotic system, the quantum kicked rotor. The transition bears a firm analogy to a thermodynamic phase transition, with the time mimicking the temperature and the quantum expectation of the rotor's kinetic energy mimicking the free energy. The transition signals a sudden change in the system's memory behavior: before the critical time, the system undergoes chaotic motion in phase space and its memory of initial states is erased in the course of time; after the critical time, quantum interference enhances the probability for a chaotic trajectory to return to the initial state, and thus the system's memory is recovered. Quantum chaos is usually defined as the behavior of a quantum system whose classical limit is chaotic [1], and has long been an elusive subject. Quantum and classical chaos may differ dramatically because Schr{\"{o}}dinger's equation is linear, and does not lead to the sensitivity to initial conditions, which is the main characteristic of classical chaos. A particularly important consequence is that classical chaos erases the memory of initial states rapidly, whereas quantum chaos can remember an initial state at long times. A natural question is thus, how, precisely, the interplay between classical chaos and quantum effects leads to the recovery of memory. For sufficiently short times, the behavior of a quantum system is (largely) classical; only after quantum interference effects are built up has the dynamics become truly quantum. For quantum chaos this happens at the so-called Ehrenfest time, when quantum-classical correspondence breaks down [2]. This question is crucial not only to understand quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems but also to realize quantum control of chaos. In addition, it can shed new light on many intriguing chaotic phenomena found in a variety of quantum systems recently (see, e.g., Refs. [3-9]). Whereas this interplay has been investigated theoretically from different perspectives [10-17], experimental results are rare: most experiments focus on the deep quantum regime, where information on classical chaos is difficult to extract, and thus cannot address the interplay and memory recovering processes. The experimental results and the theoretical interpretation presented in this work show the existence of a time-driven phase transition directly related to this interplay. By studying the early dynamics of a quantum chaotic system, we observe a nonanalyticity in the time dependence of a measurable observable. This nonanalyticity is a direct evidence of a sudden change in the system's memory behavior, which can be attributed to the subtle quantum interference effects arising from the quantum chaotic nature of the system. This is a striking difference between the classical chaotic and the quantum chaotic behaviors, shedding important new light on classical to quantum chaos transition. We study a "standard model" of quantum chaos, the quantum kicked rotor (QKR), which is a quantum particle moving on a ring under the influence of sequential pulsed driving in time ("kick") [18]. Despite its simplicity, the QKR embodies the most important properties of generic quantum chaotic systems, the realization of which remains challenging. As such, the QKR has become a paradigmatic system in experimental studies of quantum chaos (see Ref. [19] for a review). Its Hamiltonian is time dependent and assumes a general form, ˆ HðtÞ ¼ ˆ p 2 2 þ K cos ½ˆx½ˆx − aðtÞ X n $\delta$ðt − nÞ; ð1Þ where all quantities are rescaled and dimensionless (see below the description of the experiment for details). The first term inˆHðtÞinˆ inˆHðtÞ describes the rotor's free motion and the second the driving switched on at integer times t ¼ n, the kicking strength is K, and the reduced Planck's constant {\`{A}} k gives ½ˆx½ˆx; ˆ p ¼ i {\`{A}} k. The above model differs from the standard QKR by the presence of a phase modulation aðtÞ. By varying aðtÞ, rich dynamical phenomena arise. When aðtÞ is constant, the system reduces to the standard},

abstract = {Two-dimensional massless fermion field theories with quartic interactions are analyzed. These models are asymptotically free. The models are expanded in powers of 1/N, where N is the number of components of the fermion field. In such an expansion one can explicitly sum to all orders in the coupling constants. It is found that dynamical symmetry breaking occurs in these models for any value of the coupling constant. The resulting theories produce a fermion mass dynamically, in addition to a scalar bound state and, if the broken symmetry is continuous, a Goldstone boson. The resulting theories contain no adjustable parameters. The search for symmetry breaking is performed using functional techniques, the new feature here being that a composite field, say $\psi$̅ $\psi$, develops a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value. The "potential" of composite fields is discussed and constructed. General results are derived for arbitrary theories in which all masses are generated dynamically. It is proved that in asymptotically free theories the dynamical masses must depend on the coupling constants in a nonanalytic fashion, vanishing exponentially when these vanish. It is argued that infrared-stable theories, such as massless-fermion quantum electrodynamics, cannot produce masses dynamically. Four-dimensional scalar field theories with quartic interactions are analyzed in the large-N limit and are shown to yield unphysical results. The models are extended to include gauge fields. It is then found that the gauge vector mesons acquire a mass through a dynamical Higgs mechanism. The higher-order corrections, of order 1/N, to the models are analyzed. Essential singularities, of the Borel-summable type, are discovered at zero coupling constant. The origin of the singularities is the ultraviolet behavior of the theory.},

abstract = {1 We propose an efficient protocol for digital quantum simulation of quantum chemistry problems and enhanced digital-analog quantum simulation of transport phenomena in biomolecules with superconducting circuits. Along these lines, we optimally digitize fermionic models of molecular structure with single-qubit and two-qubit gates, by means of Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and Jordan-Wigner transformation. Furthermore, we address the modelling of system-environment interactions of biomolecules involving bosonic degrees of freedom with a digital-analog approach. Finally, we consider gate-truncated quantum algorithms to allow the study of environmental effects. The field of quantum chemistry arises from the application of quantum mechanics in physical models to explain the properties of chemical and biological systems 1,2 . The study of complex electronic structures in atoms and molecules encounters the difficulty of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimensions with the system size 3,4 . This fact limits the results reachable with current computers and classical algorithms, and strongly suggests to explore the possibilities of new quantum-based tools 5,6 . Quantum simulations are a powerful field based on the imitation of the dynamics of a quantum system in a controllable quantum platform 7,8 . Theoretical and experimental efforts for solving problems in physical chemis-try have been performed in technologies such as NMR 9 , trapped ions 10–12 , photonic systems 13–15 , and supercon-ducting circuits 16 , among others. Quantum algorithms for the simulation of electronic structures with fermionic degrees of freedom and its optimisation have been widely studied 17–24 . Environmental effects also play a crucial role in quantum physics, chemistry and biology 25,26 . Fundamental phenomena such as electronic transport and electron transfer are described through the correlated dynamics of electrons and phonons, involving bosonic and fermionic modes. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cutting-edge technology in terms of design versatility, coher-ent control, and scalability 27 . Indeed, remarkable experimental progress in cQED has enabled the realisation of digital quantum simulations of fermions 28 , spin systems 29 , and adiabatic quantum computing 30 . These aspects, along with the possibility of encoding both fermions and bosons in this platform via digital 31–34 and digital-analog techniques 35 , make cQED a suitable platform for simulating electronic Hamiltonians 36 and dissipative processes. In this manuscript, we combine efficient digital quantum simulation techniques for electronic Hamiltonians with existing algorithms in quantum chemistry, and we analyze the scalability and feasibility according to the state-of-the-art cQED 27 . In this sense, we study the gate fidelities required for the proposed tasks and the error propagation. We extend these procedures by exploiting the possibility of mimicking bosons in superconducting circuits taking full advantage of the multimode spectrum of superconducting transmission lines 37–41 , and propose digital-analog quantum simulations of electron transfer and electronic transport in biomolecules 42–44 .

These proposals are critically examined with emphasis on the dynamic length scale associated with spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics and the static point-to-set or mosaic length scale of the random first-order transition theory of equilibrium glass transition. Available results for these length scales, obtained mostly from simulations, are summarized, and the relation of the growth of timescales near the glass transition with the growth of these length scales is exam-ined.

abstract = {Many complexity measures are defined as the size of a minimal representation in a specific model class. One such complexity measure, which is important be- cause it is widely applied, is statistical complexity. It is defined for discrete-time, stationary stochastic processes within a theory called computational mechanics. Here, a mathematically rigorous, more general version of this theory is presented, and abstract properties of statistical complexity as a function on the space of pro- cesses are investigated. In particular, weak-∗ lower semi-continuity and concavity are shown, and it is argued that these properties should be shared by all sensible complexity measures. Furthermore, a formula for the ergodic decomposition is obtained.
The same results are also proven for two other complexity measures that are defined by different model classes, namely process dimension and generative com- plexity. These two quantities, and also the information theoretic complexity mea- sure called excess entropy, are related to statistical complexity, and this relation is discussed here.
It is also shown that computational mechanics can be reformulated in terms of Frank Knight's prediction process, which is of both conceptual and technical in- terest. In particular, it allows for a unified treatment of different processes and facilitates topological considerations. Continuity of the Markov transition kernel of a discrete version of the prediction process is obtained as a new result.},

abstract = {It is well known in thermodynamics that the creation of correlations costs work. It seems then a truism that if a thermodynamic transformation A → B is impossible, so will be any transformation that in sending A to B also correlates among them some auxiliary systems C. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case for nonequilibrium thermodynamics of microscopic systems. On the contrary, the creation of correlations greatly extends the set of accessible states, to the point that we can perform on individual systems and in a single shot any transformation that would otherwise be possible only if the number of systems involved was very large. We also show that one only ever needs to create a vanishingly small amount of correlations (as measured by mutual information) among a small number of auxiliary systems (never more than three). The many, severe constraints of microscopic thermodynamics are reduced to the sole requirement that the nonequilibrium free energy decreases in the transformation. This shows that, in principle, reliable extraction of work equal to the free energy of a system can be performed by microscopic engines.},

As disorder is weakened below a critical value, these nonthermal quantum glasses melt via a continuous dynamical phase transition into classical thermal liquids. By accounting for collective resonant tunneling processes, we derive and numerically solve an effective model for such quantum-to-classical transitions and compute their universal critical properties. Notably, the classical thermal liquid exhibits a broad regime of anomalously slow subdiffusive equilibration dynamics and energy transport. The subdiffusive regime is characterized by a continuously evolving dynamical critical exponent that diverges with a universal power at the transition. Our approach elucidates the universal long-distance, low-energy scaling structure of many-body delocalization transitions in one dimension, in a way that is transparently connected to the underlying microscopic physics. We discuss experimentally testable signatures of the predicted scaling properties.},

Numerous interesting questions have been addressed so far. Here an important part of this field, the properties of the entanglement in many-body systems, are reviewed. The zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion, and boson model systems are discussed. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium entanglement is shown tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test. Out of equilibrium entangled states are generated and manipulated by means of many-body Hamiltonians. DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.80.517 PACS number͑s͒: 05.30.Ϫd, 03.65.Ud CONTENTS I.

This is motivated by the related question of constructing symmetric informationally complete POVMs ͑SIC-POVMs͒ for which the inner products are perfectly uniform. However, SIC-POVMs are notoriously hard to construct and, despite some success of constructing them numerically, there is no analytic construction known. We present two constructions of approximate versions of SIC-POVMs, where a small deviation from uniformity of the inner products is allowed. The first construction is based on selecting vectors from a maximal collection of mutually unbiased bases and works whenever the dimension of the system is a prime power. The second construction is based on perturbing the matrix elements of a subset of mutually unbiased bases. Moreover, we construct vector systems in C n which are almost orthogonal and which might turn out to be useful for quantum computation. Our constructions are based on results of analytic number theory.},

This model has been tradi-tionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, com-plex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchro-nization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engi-neering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing prob-lems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.},

We show that the strength of the next-nearest-neighbor terms required to observe clear signatures of nonintegrability is inversely proportional to the system size. Interestingly, the transition to chaos is also seen to depend on particle statistics, with bosons responding first to the integrability breaking terms.

We also find an infinite new family of inequalities applicable to 5 or more regions. The set of all holographic entropy inequali-ties bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces. We find that, for a fixed number of regions, there are only finitely many independent entropy inequalities. To establish new holographic entropy inequalities, we introduce a combinatorial proof tech-nique that may also be of independent interest in Riemannian geometry and graph theory.},

A consistent physical theory of quantum mechanics can be built on a complex Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian but satisfies the less restrictive and more physical condition of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry). Thus, there are infinitely many new Hamiltonians that one can construct to explain experimental data. One might expect that a quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian would violate unitarity. However, if PT symmetry is not spontaneously broken, it is possible to construct a previously unnoticed physical symmetry C of the Hamiltonian. Using C, an inner product is constructed whose associated norm is positive definite. This construction is completely general and works for any PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Observables exhibit CPT symmetry, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. This work is not in conflict with conventional quantum mechanics but is rather a complex generalisation of it.},

abstract = {The quantum dynamics of interacting many-body systems has become a unique venue for the realization of novel states of matter. Here, we unveil a new class of nonequilibrium states that are eigenstates of an emergent local Hamiltonian. The latter is explicitly time dependent and, even though it does not commute with the physical Hamiltonian, it behaves as a conserved quantity of the time-evolving system. We discuss two examples of integrable systems in which the emergent eigenstate solution can be applied for an extensive (in system size) time: transport in one-dimensional lattices with initial particle (or spin) imbalance and sudden expansion of quantum gases in optical lattices. We focus on noninteracting spinless fermions, hard-core bosons, and the Heisenberg model. We show that current-carrying states can be ground states of emergent local Hamiltonians, and that they can exhibit a quasimomentum distribution function that is peaked at nonzero (and tunable) quasimomentum. We also show that time-evolving states can be highly excited eigenstates of emergent local Hamiltonians, with an entanglement entropy that does not exhibit volume-law scaling.},

Further, a natural extension of the Gibbs ensemble to integrable systems results in a theory that is able to predict the mean values of physical observables after relaxation. Finally, we show that our generalized equilibrium carries more memory of the initial conditions than the usual thermodynamic one.

abstract = {The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) posits that the reduced density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is "thermal." Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: for which class of operators, local or non-local, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: is the Hamiltonian of a system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH where in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as the subsystem size is much less than the total system size, irrespective of how large the subsystem is compared to any intrinsic length scale of the system. This allows one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy densities/temperatures using just a {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}single{\}}{\$} eigenstate. We provide support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a non-integrable 1D lattice quantum model with only energy conservation. In addition, we examine the case in which the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the total system size, and find that even in this case, a large class of operators continue to match their canonical expectation values. Specifically, the von Neumann entanglement entropy equals the thermal entropy as long as the subsystem is less than half the total system. We also study, both analytically and numerically, a particle number conserving model at infinite temperature which substantiates our conjectures.},

R ichard Feynman's presentation 'There's plenty of room at the bottom' 1 at the American Physical Society meeting in 1959 is widely acknowledged as one of the main inspirations for the development of nanotechnologies. In the same talk, Feynman also anticipated the possibilities that quantum mechanics can offer us in the microscopic world: " When we get to the very, very small world we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. " The field of quantum information explores such 'different things' and tries to exploit the laws of quantum mechanics that involve the superposition principle to carry out computational tasks in a more efficient way than is possible with devices governed by classical physics. Experimental progress during the past decades has been extraordinary, and has enabled us to isolate single microscopic particles, to manipulate and control their internal quantum states, and to detect them with almost perfect fidelity. Those advances notwithstanding, a quantum computer is still a long-term goal, requiring the full control of a many-body system and, eventually, the implementation of sophisticated error-correction protocols to achieve fault tolerance. So, as we still have to wait for a fully fledged universal quantum-information processor, is it possible to build on the experimental advances made so far, and construct a device not quite at the level of complexity of a quantum computer, but one that still could perform some tasks that classical devices cannot?},

abstract = {Thermodynamics is a highly successful macroscopic theory widely used across the natural sciences and for the construction of everyday devices, from car engines to solar cells. With thermodynamics predating quantum theory, research now aims to uncover the thermodynamic laws that govern finite size systems which may in addition host quantum effects. Recent theoretical breakthroughs include the characterisation of the efficiency of quantum thermal engines, the extension of classical non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to the quantum regime and a new thermodynamic resource theory has led to the discovery of a set of second laws for finite size systems. These results have substantially advanced our understanding of nanoscale thermodynamics, however putting a finger on what is genuinely quantum in quantum thermodynamics has remained a challenge. Here we identify information processing tasks, the so-called projections, that can only be formulated within the framework of quantum mechanics. We show that the physical realisation of such projections can come with a non-trivial thermodynamic work only for quantum states with coherences. This contrasts with information erasure, first investigated by Landauer, for which a thermodynamic work cost applies for classical and quantum erasure alike. Repercussions on quantum work fluctuation relations and thermodynamic single-shot approaches are also discussed. When Landauer argued in 1961 that any physical realisation of erasure of information has a fundamental ther-modynamic work cost he irrevocably linked thermodynamics and information theory 9. A practical consequence of this insight is that all computers must dissipate a minimal amount of heat in each irreversible computing step, a threshold that is becoming a concern with future computer chips entering atomic scales. The treatment of general quantum information processing tasks within the wider framework of quantum thermodynamics has only recently begun 1-5. Quantum mechanics differs from classical mechanics in at least three central aspects: the special nature of measurement, the possibility of a quantum system to be in a superposition and the existence of quantum correlations. The thermodynamic energy needed to perform a (selective) measurement has been investigated 10 and the total work for a closed thermodynamic measurement cycle explored 11. The catalytic role of quantum superposition states when used in thermal operations has been uncovered 12 and it has been shown that work can be drawn from quantum correlations 13,14 in a thermodynamic setting, see Fig. 1. In particular, del Rio et al. 14 showed that contrary to Landauer's principle, it is possible to extract work while performing erasure of a system's state when the system is correlated to a memory. This can occur if and only if the initial correlations imply a negative conditional entropy, a uniquely quantum feature. The thermodynamic process does however now require operation on degrees of freedom external to the system, i.e. the memory's. Results Projections and the optimal work value of removing coherences. Our motivation is here to shed light on the implications of performing a measurement on a quantum state that has coherences. We will consider this task in the thermodynamic setting of Landauer's erasure, involving a heat bath at fixed temperature T and operation on N → ∞ uncorrelated and identically prepared copies of the system (i.i.d. limit). This is of interest in the context of the quantum Jarzynski equality, for example, and will also be central for experiments testing quantum thermodynamic predictions in the future. To tackle this question we define the information-theoretic "pro-jection" $\rho$ $\eta$ $\rho$ → =∑ $\Pi$ $\Pi$ : k k k    for a given initial quantum state $\rho$ and a complete set of mutually orthogonal projectors  $\Pi$ {\{} {\}} k k. Such state transformation can be seen as analogous to the state transfer of erasure, $\rho$ → 0 , to a blank state 0.

We adapt the highly successful density-matrix renormalization group method, which is usually used to find modestly entangled ground states of local Hamiltonians, to find individual highly excited eigenstates of MBL Hamiltonians. The adaptation builds on the distinctive spatial structure of such eigenstates. We benchmark our method against the well-studied random field Heisenberg model in one dimension. At moderate to large disorder, the method successfully obtains excited eigenstates with high accuracy, thereby enabling a study of MBL systems at much larger system sizes than those accessible to exact-diagonalization methods.},

These tunable " broad " d-wave resonances, especially the one in the lowest-energy open channel, could find important applications in simulating d-wave coupling dominated many-body systems.

For short-range interacting systems, the well-known Lieb–Robinson bound defines the effective light cone with an exponentially small error with respect to the spatial distance, whereas we can obtain only polynomially small errors for distance in long-range interacting systems. In this paper, we derive a qualitatively new bound for quantum dynamics by considering how many spins can correlate with each other after time evolution. Our bound characterizes the number of spins which support the many-body entanglement with exponentially small errors and is valid for a large class of Hamiltonians including long-range interacting systems. To demonstrate the advantage of our approach in quantum many-body systems, we apply our bound to prove several fundamental properties which have not been derived from the Lieb–Robinson bound.},

@article{Gemmer2001,
abstract = {We reinterpret the microcanonical conditions in the quantum domain as constraints for the interaction of the " gas subsystem " under consideration and its environment (" container "). The time average of a purity measure is found to equal the average over the respective path in Hilbert space. We then show that for typical (degenerate or nondegenerate) thermodynamical systems almost all states within the allowed region of Hilbert space have a local von Neumann entropy S close to the maximum and a purity P close to its minimum, respectively. Typically, thermodynamical systems should obey the second law. The second law has been formulated in a number of different ways [1]: According to Clausius' postulate heat cannot flow spontaneously from a colder to a hotter system. Thomson's formulation reads as follows: " It is impossible to construct a perpetuum mobile of the second kind. " Such rules define, essentially, some sort of irreversibility, i.e., the existence of a state function usually called entropy, S, which can increase only in closed systems [2]. The second law is arguably one of the most funda-mental and far-reaching laws of physics; nevertheless, its origin remains puzzling. On the macroscopic level the second law enables us to calculate state equations from the requirement that entropy has to be maximized un-der the condition of given extensive variables in order to get a thermodynamical potential as a function of those. On the microscopic level irreversibility comes in conflict with the notorious reversibility of all fundamental physi-cal laws. It has been the challenge for statistical mechanics to reconcile dS͞dt {\$} 0 with the underlying microscopic dynamics. Irreversibility in classical mechanics is convention-ally introduced via two different schemes (cf. [3]): the Boltzmann approach, based on the hypothesis of molecu-lar chaos (Stosszahlansatz), and the Gibbs ensemble approach, based on the hypothesis of quasiergodicity. Both these attempts have to acknowledge some additional assumptions which do not follow from the underlying microscopic laws. This fact has led to continuing contro-versies as to whether this situation can be the last word. Several researchers suggested quantum mechanics as a possible remedy. Landau and Lifshitz [4] expected that quantum measurements — making a difference between future and past — should be responsible for the entropy increase according to the second law. This assertion has never been proved, though. Schr{\"{o}}dinger [5] argued that the conventional canonical distributions of thermo-dynamics can be obtained also for a system described by a single wave function, if one invokes " the old crux of molecular disorder. " von Neumann [3] was able to show that a nondegenerate system should, indeed, obey a quantum-mechanical version of ergodicity under fairly weak conditions. In addition, he felt obliged to introduce " macroscopic observers " (coarse graining) in order to come into contact with standard thermodynamics. This latter aspect has then been taken up also by Pauli and Fierz [6]. These authors insisted that the second law should be explained without reference to external per-turbations like those induced by quantum measurements. Lindblad [7] observed that the entropy of a multipartite system defined as the sum of the respective partial entropies of the subsystems would tend to increase due to the neglect of correlations (entanglement). This fact could be taken as a quantum-mechanical justification of Boltzmann's Stosszahlansatz. Zurek [8] and his co-workers have discussed in great detail how the interaction of a quantum system with its environment may induce quasiclassical behavior in the former (" environment-induced superselection rules "). They argued that the second law should eventually result from the impossibility of isolating macroscopic systems from their environ-ment [9]. In this Letter, we show that under (appropriately redefined) microcanonical conditions the second law of thermodynamics follows from a quantum-mechanical analysis of the total system partitioned into the object and the environment. A purity measure that is formulated within standard quantum mechanics but has also an interpretation within thermodynamics is the von Neumann entropy},

Over the past decades, these powerful conceptual and mathemati-cal tools were extended to continuous phase transitions separating distinct nonequilibrium stationary states in driven classical and quantum systems. In concordance with detailed numerical simulations and laboratory experi-ments, several prominent dynamical universality classes have emerged that govern large-scale, long-time scaling properties both near and far from ther-mal equilibrium. These pertain to genuine specific critical points as well as entire parameter space regions for steady states that display generic scale invariance. The exploration of nonstationary relaxation properties and asso-ciated physical aging scaling constitutes a complementary potent means to characterize cooperative dynamics in complex out-of-equilibrium systems. This review describes dynamic scaling features through paradigmatic exam-ples that include near-equilibrium critical dynamics, driven lattice gases and growing interfaces, correlation-dominated reaction-diffusion systems, and basic epidemic models.},

The generalization of our class of entanglement measures to more than two particles is straightforward. We present a measure which has a statistical operational basis that might enable experimental determination of the quantitative degree of entanglement. [S0031-9007(97)02751-8] PACS numbers: 89.70. + c, 89.80.+h, 03.65.Bz We have witnessed great advances in quantum informa-tion theory in recent years. There are two distinct direc-tions in which progress is currently being made: quantum computation and error correction on the one hand (for a short survey see [1,2]), and nonlocality, Bell's inequali-ties, and purification, on the other hand [3,4]. There has also been a number of papers relating the two methods (e.g., [5,6]). Our present work belongs to this second group. Recently it was realized that the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) form of Bell's inequalities are not a sufficiently good measure of quantum correlations in the sense that there are states which do not violate the CHSH inequality, but, on the other hand, can be purified by lo-cal interactions and classical communications to yield a state that does violate the CHSH inequality [3]. Subse-quently, it was shown that the only states of two two-level systems which cannot be purified are those that can be written as the sum over density operators which are direct product states of the two subsystems [7]. Therefore, al-though it is possible to say whether a quantum state is en-tangled or not, the amount of entanglement cannot easily be determined for general mixed states. Bennett et al. [5] have recently proposed a measure of entanglement for a general mixed state of two quantum subsystems. How-ever, this measure has the disadvantage that it is hard to compute for a general state, even numerically. In this Letter we specify conditions which any measure of en-tanglement has to satisfy and construct a whole class of " good " entanglement measures. Our measures are geo-metrically intuitive. Unless stated otherwise, the following considerations apply to a system composed of two quantum subsystem of arbitrary dimensions. First, we define the term purifi-cation procedure more precisely. There are three distinct ingredients in any protocol that aims at increasing corre-lations between two quantum subsystems locally. Local general measurements (LGM).—These are per-formed by the two parties (A and B) separately and are described by two sets of operators satisfying the com-pleteness relations P i A},

abstract = {Reichenbach's principle asserts that if two observed variables are found to be correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations. Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner Reichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for quantum causal models and provide examples of how the formalism works.},

The approach is genuine quantum in the sense that statistical behavior is a consequence of objective quantum uncertainties due to entanglement and uncertainty relations. No additional randomness is added by hand and no assumptions about a priori probabilities are made, instead measure concentra- tion results are used to justify the methods of Statistical Physics. The approach explains the applicability of the microcanonical and canonical ensemble and the tendency to equilibrate in a natural way. This work contains a pedagogical review of the existing literature and some new results. The most important of which are: i) A measure theoretic justification for the microcanonical ensemble. ii) Bounds on the subsystem equilibration time. iii) A proof that a generic weak interaction causes decoherence in the energy eigenbasis. iv) A proof of a quantum H-Theorem. v) New estimates of the average effective dimension for initial product states and states from the mean energy ensemble. vi) A proof that time and ensemble averages of observables are typically close to each other. vii) A bound on the fluctuations of the purity of a system coupled to a bath.},

abstract = {The relation between the distribution of work performed on a classical system by an external force switched on an arbitrary time scale and the corresponding equilibrium free energy difference is generalized to quantum systems. Using the adiabatic representation, we show that this relation holds for isolated systems as well as for systems coupled to a bath described by a master equation. A close formal analogy is established between the present ''classical trajectory'' picture over populations of adiabatic states and phase fluctuations (dephasing) of a quantum coherence in spectral line shapes, described by the stochastic Liouville equation. Jarzynski [1,2] had established a remarkably simple and general relationship between the distribution of work performed on a classical system by an external force and the free energy difference between the initial and final states [3-5]. This interesting prediction, connecting equilibrium quantities (free energies) to nonequilibrium tra-jectories corresponding to measurements performed on an arbitrary time scale, has recently been verified in single molecule measurements [6]. In this Letter we utilize the adiabatic representation [7] to prove that this relation holds equally for quantum systems. For an isolated driven quantum system (i.e., not coupled to a bath) the work does not depend on the path, and the proof follows directly from a sum rule of nonadiabatic couplings. We further develop a path integral representation of systems coupled to a bath described by a master equation in the adiabatic basis using ''trajecto-ries'' over adiabatic state populations, and generalize Jarzynski's relation to obtain the joint distribution of work and energy in a nonequilibrium measurement. A close resemblance is established between the physical picture underlying the distribution of work and the distribution of phase acquired by a quantum coherence due to coupling to a bath. Consider a quantum system coupled to an external force which changes its Hamiltonian Ht by switching a parameter t from  0 at t  0 to  1 at time t. Initially the system is in thermal equilibrium and the instantaneous energy levels [eigenvalues of Ht] are denoted n t, with the corresponding eigenstates j' n ti. The canonical partition function for a given value of is Z  X n exp{\"{y}} n t exp{\"{y}}F ; (1) where F is the Helmholtz free energy. Let us consider an externally driven, but otherwise isolated, system. In the adiabatic representation [7] we expand its density matrix as t  X nm nm tj' n tih' m tj; (2) where the coefficients nm t satisfy the Liouville equation d dt kl t  {\"{y}}i! kl t kl t {\"{y}} X mn S kl;mn t mn t (3) with ! kl t k t {\"{y}} l t and S kl;mn t  h' k tj {\_} ' ' m ti ln  h {\_} ' ' n tj' l ti km : (4) The nonadiabatic coupling S is of purely quantum origin and has no classical analog. For a given realization of t, the solution of Eq. (3) allows us to compute the conditional probability K mn t of the system to be in the state j' m ti at time t given that it started at state j' n 0i, so that mm t  K mn t nn 0. This probability is normalized by summing over final states P m K mn t  1. A second, less obvious, sum rule is obtained by summation over initial states P n K mn t  1. When the external force varies slowly, it follows from the adiabatic theorem [7] that no nonadiabatic transitions take place, K mn t  mn , and this sum rule trivially holds. For finite switching time scales there are nonadia-batic transitions and the instantaneous eigenstates j' n ti are no longer the solutions of the time dependent Schr{\"{o}} dinger equation. Nevertheless, the second sum rule follows from the relation X n S kl;nn t  d dt h' k tj' l ti  0: (5) A direct consequence of Eq. (5) is that the following uniform distribution in adiabatic population space, obtained by setting nm t  nm at all times in Eq. (2), t  X n j' n tih' n tj; (6) satisfies the Liouville equation.

In this work, we establish a novel link between dynamical properties - the absence of a group velocity and transport - with entanglement properties of individual eigenvectors. Using Lieb-Robinson bounds and filter functions, we prove rigorously under simple assumptions on the spectrum that if a system shows strong dynamical localisation, all of its many-body eigenvectors have clustering correlations. In one dimension this implies directly an entanglement area law, hence the eigenvectors can be approximated by matrix-product states. We also show this statement for parts of the spectrum, allowing for the existence of a mobility edge above which transport is possible.},

abstract = {The construction of a perfectly secure private quantum channel in dimension d is known to require 2 log d shared random key bits between the sender and receiver. We show that if only near-perfect security is required, the size of the key can be reduced by a factor of two. More specifically, we show that there exists a set of roughly d log d unitary operators whose average effect on every input pure state is almost perfectly ran-domizing, as compared to the d 2 operators required to randomize perfectly. Aside from the private quantum channel, variations of this construction can be applied to many other tasks in quantum information processing. We show, for instance, that it can be used to construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more efficient than any others known, allowing roughly log d qubits to be hidden in 2 log d qubits. The method can also be used to exhibit the existence of quantum states with locked classical correlations, an arbitrarily large amplification of the correlation being accomplished by sending a negligibly small classical key. Our construction also provides the basic build-ing block for a method of remotely preparing arbitrary d-dimensional pure quantum states using approximately log d bits of communication and log d ebits of entanglement.},

abstract = {We show, through a refinement of the work theorem, that the average dissipation, upon perturbing a Hamiltonian system arbitrarily far out of equilibrium in a transition between two canonical equilibrium states, is exactly given by hW diss i  hWi {\"{y}} F  kTD k e   kThln=e i, where and e are the phase-space density of the system measured at the same intermediate but otherwise arbitrary point in time, for the forward and backward process. D k e  is the relative entropy of versus e. This result also implies general inequalities, which are significantly more accurate than the second law and include, as a special case, the celebrated Landauer principle on the dissipation involved in irreversible computations. Since the pioneering work of Boltzmann, the search for an exact microscopic expression of dissipation has been at the heart of (nonequilibrium) statistical mechanics. In this Letter, we derive such an expression from first principles, through a refinement of the recently discovered work theorem by Jarzynski and Crooks [1]. The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that the average mechanical work hWi needed to move a system in contact with a heat bath at temperature T, from one equilibrium state A into another equilibrium state B, is at least equal to the free energy difference between these states: hWi F  F B {\"{y}} F A. The equality is reached for a qua-sistatic process. The extra work hWi {\"{y}} F is often referred to as the dissipated work. Contrary to the reversible work, the dissipated work depends on how the transition between the states is realized. Typically, one or more external control parameters are changed in time, following a specific protocol, between initial and final values. The dissipated work will depend on this protocol, which can in principle bring the system arbitrarily far out of equilibrium. Amazingly, there exists an exact, simple, and compact microscopic expression for this dissipation. The key is to consider the protocol and its time-reversed version. We will refer with a superscript tilde to all the quantities measured in the time-reversed protocol. The central result is then the following: hW diss i  hWi {\"{y}} F  kTDjj {\~{}}   kThln=e i, where and e are the phase-space densities of the system measured at the same intermediate but otherwise arbitrary point in time, in the forward and backward protocol, respectively. D k e  is the Kullback-Leibler distance [2], also called relative entropy, of versus e. The derivation is similar in spirit to that of the Jarzynski and Crooks equalities [1]. Consider a Hamiltonian Hq; p; , where q; p represents the set of position and momentum variables of the system under consideration and is a control parameter which is varied from an initial value A to a final value B , according to a protocol t controlled by an external agent. The system is initially assumed to be in canonical equilibrium at temperature T at the value A of the control parameter and, along the protocol, is completely isolated; i.e., no energy is exchanged other than the work W performed by the external agent on the system. In the time-reversed scenario, the system is initially at canonical equilibrium at the same temperature T, but at the value B of the control parameter, which is now changed according to the exact time-reversed protocol. We first set out to calculate the work Wq; p; t done along the whole process, for the specific phase trajectory that passes through the phase point q; p at time t. Since the dynamics are deterministic, there is precisely one such trajectory. Let us call q 0 ; p 0  and q 1 ; p 1  the corresponding initial and final phase points uniquely determined by q; p. Note also that there is a one-to-one correspondence with the time-reversed trajectory in the time-reversed protocol which, starting from q 1 ; {\"{y}}p 1 , goes through q; {\"{y}}p and, finally, into q 0 ; {\"{y}}p 0 , cf. Fig. 1. For simplicity of notation, we will use the forward time to express times in both forward and backward scenarios. By conservation of total energy, one has that Wq; p; t  Hq 1 ; p 1 ; B  {\"{y}} Hq 0 ; p 0 ; A ; (1) where q i  q i q; p and p i  p i q; p for i  0; 1.

abstract = {Quantum simulation methods based on electronic-structure theory are deemed unfit to cope with atomic heat transport within the Green–Kubo formalism, because quantum-mechanical energy densities and currents are inherently ill-defined at the atomic scale. We show that, although this diiculty would also aaect classical simulations, thermal conductivity is indeed insensitive to such ill-definedness by virtue of a kind of gauge invariance resulting from energy extensivity and conservation. On the basis of these findings, we derive an expression for the adiabatic energy flux from density-functional theory, which allows heat transport to be simulated using ab initio equilibrium molecular dynamics. Our methodology is demonstrated by comparing its predictions to those of classical equilibrium and ab initio non-equilibrium (M{\"{u}}ller–Plathe) simulations for a liquid-argon model, and by applying it to heavy water at ambient conditions. U nderstanding heat transport is key in many fields of science and technology, such as materials and planetary sciences, energy saving, heat dissipation and shielding, or thermoelectric conversion, to name but a few. Heat transport in insulators is determined by the dynamics of atoms, the electrons following adiabatically in their ground state. Simulating atomic heat transport usually relies on Boltzmann's kinetic approach 1 , or on molecular dynamics (MD), both in its equilibrium (Green–Kubo, GK; refs 2–5) and non-equilibrium 4–6 flavours. The Boltzmann equation applies only to crystalline solids well below melting, whereas classical MD (CMD) bears on those materials and conditions that can be modelled by interatomic potentials. Equilibrium ab initio (AI) MD (refs 7,8) is set to overcome these limitations, but it is still surprisingly thought to be unfit to cope with thermal transport 'because in first-principles calculations it is impossible to uniquely decompose the total energy into individual contributions from each atom' (excerpted from ref. 9). Such a unique decomposition is not possible in classical mechanics either, because the potential energy of a system of interacting atoms can be partitioned into local contributions in an infinite number of equivalent ways. The quantum-mechanical energy density is also affected by a similar indeterminacy. Notwithstanding, the expression for the heat conductivity derived from any sensible energy partitioning or density should obviously be well defined, as any measurable quantity must. In this work we first demonstrate that the thermal conductivity resulting from the GK relation is unaffected by the indeterminacy of the microscopic energy density; we then introduce a form of energy density, and a corresponding adiabatic energy flux, from which heat-transport coefficients can be computed within the GK formalism, using density-functional theory 10,11 (DFT). Our approach is validated by comparing the results of equilibrium AIMD to those of non-equilibrium (M{\"{u}}ller–Plathe, MP; ref. 6) AIMD and equilibrium CMD simulations for a liquid-argon model, for which accurate interatomic potentials are derived by matching the forces generated by them with quantum-mechanical forces computed along the AIMD trajectories. The case of molecular fluids is finally addressed, and illustrated in the case of water at ambient conditions. Theory},

abstract = {We investigate the stability of the many-body localized phase for a system in contact with a single ergodic grain modeling a Griffiths region with low disorder. Our numerical analysis provides evidence that even a small ergodic grain consisting of only three qubits can delocalize a localized chain as soon as the localization length exceeds a critical value separating localized and extended regimes of the whole system. We present a simple theory, consistent with De Roeck and Huveneers's arguments in [Phys. Rev. B 95, 155129 (2017)] that assumes a system to be locally ergodic unless the local relaxation time determined by Fermi's golden rule is larger than the inverse level spacing. This theory predicts a critical value for the localization length that is perfectly consistent with our numerical calculations. We analyze in detail the behavior of local operators inside and outside the ergodic grain and find excellent agreement of numerics and theory.},

abstract = {Extended objects, such as strings and membranes, have been studied for many years in the context of sta-tistical physics. In these systems, quantum effects are typically negligible, and the extended objects can be treated classically. Yet it is natural to wonder how strings and membranes behave in the quantum regime. In this chapter, we will investigate the properties of one dimensional, string-like, objects with large quan-tum fluctuations. Our motivation is both intellectual curiosity and (as we will see) the connection between quantum strings and topological/quantum orders in condensed matter systems. It is useful to organize our discussion using the analogy to the well understood theory of quantum par-ticles. One of the most remarkable phenomena in quantum many-particle systems is particle condensation. We can think of particle condensed states as special ground states where all the particles are described by the same quantum wave function. In some sense, all the symmetry breaking phases examples of particle con-densation: we can view the order parameter that characterizes a symmetry breaking phase as the condensed wave function of certain " effective particles. " According to this point of view, Landau's theory [Landau (1937)] for symmetry breaking phases is really a theory of " particle " condensation. The theory of particle condensation is based on the physical concepts of long range order, symmetry breaking, and order parameters, and the mathematical theory of groups. These tools allow us to solve two important problems in the study of quantum many-particle systems. First, they lead to a classification of all symmetry-breaking/particle-condensed states. For example, we know that there are only 230 different crys-tal phases in three dimensions. Second, they provide insight into the quasiparticle excitation spectrum. The collective excitations above the ground state are described by fluctuations of the amplitude of the condensed " particles " (i.e. the fluctuations of the order parameter). In many cases, symmetry breaking allows us to derive the quantum numbers of these collective excitations (or quasiparticles) and predict whether they are gapped or gapless.},

abstract = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empiri-cally verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation. It is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctu-ating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because p(t) does not depend only on p(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type p(t) = g(t, 0)p(0), where the operator g is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (O{\~{}}t) The.refore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},

This development resulted in an elaborated structural theory and was accompanied by the discovery of a whole spectrum of entropic quantities, notably the channel capacities, characterizing information-processing performance of the channels. This paper gives a survey of the main properties of quantum channels and of their entropic characterization, with a variety of examples for finite-dimensional quantum systems. We also touch upon the 'continuous-variables' case, which provides an arena for quantum Gaussian systems. Most of the practical realizations of quantum information processing were implemented in such systems, in particular based on principles of quantum optics. Several important entropic quantities are introduced and used to describe the basic channel capacity formulae. The remarkable role of specific quantum correlations-entanglement-as a novel communication resource is stressed.},

abstract = {Far from the thermodynamic equilibrium, many precipitation reactions create complex product structures with fascinating features caused by their unusual origins. Unlike the dissipative patterns in other self-organizing reactions, these features can be permanent, suggesting potential applications in materials science and engineering. We review four distinct classes of precipitation reactions, describe similarities and differences, and discuss related challenges for theoretical studies. These classes are hollow micro- and macrotubes in chemical gardens, polycrystalline silica carbonate aggregates (biomorphs), Liesegang bands, and propagating precipitation-dissolution fronts. In many cases, these systems show intricate structural hierarchies that span from the nanometer scale into the macroscopic world. We summarize recent experimental progress that often involves growth under tightly regulated conditions by means of wet stamping, holographic heating, and controlled electric, magnetic, or pH perturbations. In this research field, progress requires mechanistic insights that cannot be derived from experiments alone. We discuss how mesoscopic aspects of the product structures can be modeled by reaction-transport equations and suggest important targets for future studies that should also include materials features at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {Ruelle's principle for turbulence leading to what is usually called the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) distribution is applied to the statistical mechanics of many particle systems in nonequilibrium stationary states. A specific prediction, obtained without the need to construct explicitly the SRB itself, is shown to be in agreement with a recent computer experiment on a strongly sheared fluid. This presents the first test of the principle on a many particle system far from equilibrium. A possible application to quid mechanics is also discussed. PACS numbers: 47.52.+j, 05.45.+b, 05.70.Ln, 47.70.-n In his treatment of strange attractors Ruelle introduced, as a principle (R): the time averages of observables, on motions with initial data randomly sampled with the Liou-ville distribution p, o, are described by a stationary probability distribution p, obtained by attributing a. suitable probability density to the surface elements of the unsta ble manifolds of the points in phase space [I]. In hyper-bolic systems this leads, as a theorem, to identifying p, with the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) distribution on the attractor [1]. (R) was based on important previous results [2-6]. The unstable manifolds are quite difficult to obtain: It has been questioned whether (R) has any predictive value when it cannot be a priori proved [7]. It is implicit, we think, in Ruelle's ideas that the principle should be applied by assuming suitable properties making (R) valid and then retain the consequences concerning the large scale (in time and size) behavior. A similar situation arises in statistical mechanics where the equilibrium statistics is accepted on the basis of the ergodic principle (usually called hypothesis) and one derives the "heat theorem" (second law) and the thermodynamic properties. Analogous consequences, which would turn (R) into a tool for predictions, proved difficult to find in the case of turbulence. But recently [8] have shown that (R) does imply macroscopic consequences, e.g. , the Einstein relation for the diffusion and conductivity coefficients in systems similar to ours in the linear regime where (R) can even be proven for a single particle system. In this Letter we present consequences of a different nature that can be derived from (R) and subjected to experimental tests, particularly for non-small forcing, without having to compute rather difficult dynamical quantities like Lyapunov exponents as in [8] and without the need to compute, even approximately, p, [9]. Although our considerations appear to be quite general, this Letter is written with the theoretical interpretation of a numerical experiment in mind: the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing many particle fIuid in a nonequi-librium stationary state far from equilibrium [10]. We first define the model of the shearing fluid we treat. The two-dimensional shearing Quid is in a nonequilibrium stationary state, driven by an external shear rate y = Bu"/6y ("forcing"), where u is the horizontal local velocity u = iyy (and I is the x axis unit vector, y is the y ordinate from the baricenter) and coupled to a thermostat. The equations of motion are the SLLOD equations [11,12] q, = p, /m + iyyj, pj = Fj I'Ypyj {\~{}}pj {\~{}} (1) where j = 1,. .. , W labels the W quid particles with mass m; p{\~{}}/m is the peculiar velocity of particle j, i.e. , its velocity with respect to the local IIuid velocity u(q,) = iyy, ; p, is the peculiar momentum relative to the bari-center; and F, is the interparticle force on particle j, due to a purely repulsive pair potential p(r), where r is the interparticle distance (e.g. , an inverse power potential). If x = (p{\~{}} pzqI. qz) denotes the phase of the system , the variable a is defined by requiring the internal energy Ho(x) = g, pj/2m + 4(q{\&}.. . qz) to be a constant of motion, where C{\&}(q{\~{}}.. . qz) = g;», p({\~{}}q;-q, {\~{}}) and a can be easily computed [10]. The model is studied in [10,12, 13] with periodic (Lees-Edwards) boundary conditions, which we replace here by simpler ones: horizontally periodic boundary conditions and vertically elastic wall rellections [14]. For a dynamical description of this system one can suppose that the total (peculiar) momentum P{\~{}}{\~{}} and the center of mass position X{\~{}}{\~{}} in the shear direction vanish. If the observations are made in discrete time by observing subsequent particle collisions, then, with the constant energy, the system can be described in a phase space C of 4N-4 dimensions. The Liouville distribution can be projected on C giving a distribution p, o (to which we refer with the same name), but p, " is stationary only for y = 0. The evolution will be a map S related to the solution operator t S,x of (1) and to the time t(x) elapsing between a timing event x E C and the next: Sx = S,{\~{}}"{\~{}}x. The phase space volume variation rate, which is also the entropy production rate for this system [8,15], is the divergence of the right-hand side (rhs) of Eq. (1) and equals (2N-2)o. , with cr close to o. , in fact, one finds, after a brief computation, o-= n + y g{\~{}} p,{\~{}}pyj/(N-1) gl p{\~{}} = n + yO(N '). The 2694},

abstract = {Low-dimensional systems provide beautiful examples of many-body quantum physics 1 . For one-dimensional (1D) systems 2 , the Luttinger liquid approach 3 provides insight into universal prop-erties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly 4–7 and strongly 8,9 interacting regimes. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached 10 . Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state 11 . The time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in excellent agreement with recent predictions 12 . For two coupled 1D Bose gases, the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach 13 . This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall systems, superfluid helium and spin systems 14–16 . Our experi-ments studying coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena. The starting point of our experiments is a 1D Bose gas of a few thousand atoms trapped in a highly elongated, cylindrical magnetic microtrap on an atom chip 17,18 with typical transverse and longit-udinal oscillator frequencies of n H {\textless} 4.0 kHz and n z {\textless} 5 Hz. Our trapped Bose gas is in the 1D quasi-condensate regime 1 , which is characterized by both the temperature T and chemical potential m fulfilling k B T, m , hn H (ref. 19). After the initial preparation of this single 1D system, we perform a phase-coherent splitting along the transverse direction by means of a radio-frequency (r.f.) induced adiabatic potential 11 .

Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current.},

In the last years, periodic driving has more and more also been considered as a means for the coherent control of many-body systems. In particular, experiments with ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices subjected to periodic driving in the lower kilohertz regime have attracted much attention. Milestones include the observation of dynamic localization, the dynamic control of the quantum phase transition between a bosonic superfluid and a Mott insulator, as well as the dynamic creation of strong artificial magnetic fields and topological band structures. This Colloquium reviews these recent experiments and their theoretical description. Moreover, fundamental properties of periodically driven many-body systems are discussed within the framework of Floquet theory, including heating, relaxation dynamics, anomalous topological edge states, and the response to slow parameter variations.},

Experimental realizations of quantum computers are, however, still in their infancy. A major challenge is the realization of a qubit—the quantum version of a bit that entangles quantum states—that can be manipulated and coupled to other qubits. For example, one strategy for coupling light and matter places an atom or quantum dot in a tiny cavity, where it couples resonantly with the cavity's optical modes ( 2 ). Practical difficulties of this approach arise because a highly efficient cavity is needed, and it must also be exactly tuned to the emission frequency of the source. On page 1352 of this issue, Sapienza et al. report an approach that simplifies this problem enormously ( 3 ). They have created a photonic structure that intentionally is very disordered, in which efficient random cavities are formed at many frequencies.},

We derive a novel lattice Hamiltonian, the molecular Hubbard Hamiltonian, which describes the essential many-body physics of closed-shell ultracold heteronuclear molecules in their absolute ground state in a quasi-one-dimensional optical lattice. The molecular Hubbard Hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent, making a dynamic generalization of the concept of quantum phase transitions necessary. Using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to study entangled dynamics, we demonstrate that, in the case of hard-core bosonic molecules at half-filling, the molecular Hubbard Hamiltonian exhibits emergent timescales over which spatial entanglement grows, crystalline order appears and oscillations between rotational states self-damp into an asymptotic superposition. We show that these timescales are non-monotonic functions of the physical parameters describing the lattice.},

abstract = {The author reviews in a pedagogical fashion some of the recent developments in lattice quantum chromo-dynamics. This review emphasizes explicit examples and illustrations rather than general proofs and analy-ses. It begins with a discussion of the heavy-quark potential in continuum quantum chromodynamics. Asymptotic freedom and renormalization-group improved perturbation theory are discussed. A simple dielectric model of confinement is considered as an intuitive guide to the vacuum of non-Abelian gauge theories. Next, the Euclidean form of lattice gauge theory is introduced, and an assortment of calculational methods are reviewed. These include high-temperature expansions, duality, Monte Carlo computer simula-tions, and weak coupling expansions. A A-parameter calculation for asymptotically free-spin models is presented. The Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory is presented and is illustrated in the con-text of flux tube dynamics. Roughening transitions, Casimir forces, and the restoration of rotational sym-metry are discussed. Mechanisms of confinement in lattice theories are illustrated in the two-dimensional electrodynamics of the planar model and the U(1) gauge theory in four dimensions. Generalized actions for SU(2) gauge theories and the relevance of monopoles and strings to crossover phenomena are considered. A brief discussion of the continuity of fields and topological charge in asymptotically free lattice models is presented. The fmal major topic of this review concerns lattice fermions. The species doubling problem and its relation to chiral symmetry are illustrated. Staggered Euclidean fermion methods are discussed in detail, with an emphasis on species counting, remnants of chiral symmetry, Block spin variables, and the axial anomaly. Numerical methods for including fermions in computer simulations are considered. Jacobi and Gauss-Siedel inversion methods to obtain the fermion propagator in a background gauge field are re-viewed. Langevin, pseudofermion Monte Carlo methods, and random walk methods are discussed, as are proposals for including the fermion determinant in computer simulations. Finally, spontaneous chiral sym-metry breaking in lattice models is discussed. The review ends with brief remarks about present research directions.},

@phdthesis{Yadin2017,
abstract = {One of the fundamental features that separates quantum physics from classical physics is the idea of quantum superposition, also known as co- herence. This thesis concentrates on understanding quantum coherence in the mathematical framework of resource theories, viewing it both as a resource to be harnessed and as a way to quantitatively characterise quantum states in contrast to classical states. We first examine the type of coherence resource theory which has emerged recently to cope with general settings where the physical nature of the medium encoding information is not crucial, such as computation. We identify the set of quantum processes in which coherence is neither created nor used, and use these to provide a physically motivated resource theory pictured in terms of interferometry. Using the same concepts, we then find connections between coherence and discord, a type of quantum correlation. In particular, we show how coherence can be used to generate discord, and explore basis-dependent discord as an intermediate quantity. The second part of the thesis applies the resource theory framework to quantify quantum macroscopicity, taken here to mean the extent to which coherence exists in a system on a macroscopic scale. We find the appro- priate type of resource theory for this purpose, giving criteria for good measures of macroscopic coherence. We use these criteria to evaluate some previously proposed measures and highlight the role of the quantum Fisher information. Next, we build up measures based on the concept of macroscopic distinguishability and use them to show that macroscopic quantum states are fragile to noise induced by interaction with an environment. Finally, we apply measures based on the Fisher information to a range of experiments involving mechanical degrees of freedom, in order to compare their macroscopicity},

abstract = {Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector {\~{}} b, find a vector {\~{}} x such that A {\~{}} x ¼ {\~{}} b. We consider the case where one does not need to know the solution {\~{}} x itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with {\~{}} x, e.g., {\~{}} x y M {\~{}} x for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N {\^{A}} N and has condition number , the fastest known classical algorithms can find {\~{}} x and estimate {\~{}} x y M {\~{}} x in time scaling roughly as N ffiffiffi ffi p . Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for estimating {\~{}} x y M {\~{}} x whose runtime is a polynomial of logðNÞ and . Indeed, for small values of [i.e., poly logðNÞ], we prove (using some common complexity-theoretic assumptions) that any classical algorithm for this problem generically requires exponentially more time than our quantum algorithm. Introduction.—Quantum computers are devices that har-ness quantum mechanics to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot. For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm [1]. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems [2]) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This Letter presents a quantum algo-rithm to estimate features of the solution of a set of linear equations. Compared to classical algorithms for the same task, our algorithm can be as much as exponentially faster. Linear equations play an important role in virtually all fields of science and engineering. The sizes of the data sets that define the equations are growing rapidly over time, so that terabytes and even petabytes of data may need to be processed to obtain a solution. In other cases, such as when discretizing partial differential equations, the linear equa-tions may be implicitly defined and thus far larger than the original description of the problem. For a classical com-puter, even to approximate the solution of Nlinear equa-tions in N unknowns in general requires time that scales at least as N. Indeed, merely to write out the solution takes time of order N. Frequently, however, one is interested not in the full solution to the equations, but rather in computing some function of that solution, such as determining the total weight of some subset of the indices. We show that in some cases, a quantum computer can approximate the value of such a function in time which scales logarithmically in N, and polynomially in the con-dition number (defined below) and desired precision. The dependence on N is exponentially better than what is achievable classically, while the dependence on condition number is comparable, and the dependence on error is worse. Typically, the accuracy required is not very large. However, the condition number often scales with the size of the problem, which presents a more serious limitation of our algorithm. Coping with large condition numbers has been studied extensively in the context of classical algo-rithms. In the discussion section, we will describe the applicability of some of the classical tools (pseudoinverses, preconditioners) to our quantum algorithm. We sketch here the basic idea of our algorithm and then discuss it in more detail in the next section. Given a Hermitian N {\^{A}} N matrix A, and a unit vector {\~{}} b, suppose we would like to find {\~{}} x satisfying A {\~{}} x ¼ {\~{}} b.

The principle is that the voltage that develops across a piece of conducting material is linearly proportional to the current flowing through it; the constant of proportionality being termed the resistance, V = IR ( 1 ). Such behavior is the backbone of classical conduction in these materials. In the 1920s and 1930s, it was expected that classical behavior would operate at macroscopic scales but would break down at the microscopic scale, where it would be replaced by the new quantum mechanics. The pointlike electron motion of the classical world would be replaced by the spread out quantum waves. These quantum waves would lead to very different behavior. On page 64 of this issue, Weber et al.

abstract = {This book is an introduction to the Schwinger action principle in quan- tum mechanics and quantum field theory, with applications to a variety of different models, not only those of interest to particle physics. The book begins with a brief review of the action principle in classical mechan- ics and classical field theory. It then moves on to quantum field theory, focusing on the effective action method. This is introduced as simply as possible by using the zero-point energy of the simple harmonic oscilla- tor as the starting point. This allows the utility of the method, and the process of regularization and renormalization of quantum field theory, to be demonstrated with a minimum of formal development. The book concludes with a more complete definition of the effective action, and demonstrates how the provisional definition used earlier is the first term in the systematic loop expansion. Several applications of the Schwinger action principle are given, including Bose–Einstein condensation, the Casimir effect, and trapped Fermi gases. The renormalization of interacting scalar field theory is presented to two-loop order. This book will interest graduate students and researchers in theoretical physics who are familiar with quantum mechanics.},

abstract = {We investigate the entanglement properties of an infinite class of excited states in the quantum Lifshitz model (QLM). The presence of a conformal quantum critical point in the QLM makes it unusually tractable for a model above one spatial dimension, enabling the ground state entanglement entropy for an arbitrary domain to be expressed in terms of geometrical and topological quantities. Here we extend this result to excited states and find that the entanglement can be naturally written in terms of quantities which we dub 'entanglement propagator amplitudes' (EPAs). EPAs are geometrical probabilities that we explicitly calculate and interpret. A comparison of lattice and continuum results demonstrates that EPAs are universal. This work shows that the QLM is an example of a 2 + 1d field theory where the universal behavior of excited-state entanglement may be computed analytically.},

abstract = {Given an orthonormal basis B in a d-dimensional Hilbert space and a unital quantum operation E acting on it, one can define a nonlinear mapping that associates with E a d × d real-valued matrix that we call the coherence matrix of E with respect to B. This is the Gram matrix of the coherent part of the basis projections of B under E. We show that one can use this coherence matrix to define vast families of measures of the coherence-generating power (CGP) of the operation. These measures have a natural geometrical interpretation as separation of E from the set of incoherent unital operations. The probabilistic approach to CGP discussed in P. Zanardi et al. [ Phys. Rev. A 95, 052306 (2017).] can be reformulated and generalized, introducing, alongside the coherence matrix, another d × d real-valued matrix, the simplex correlation matrix. This matrix describes the relevant statistical correlations in the input ensemble of incoherent states. Contracting these two matrices, one finds CGP measures associated with the process of preparing the given incoherent ensemble and processing it with the chosen unital operation. Finally, in the unitary case, we discuss how these concepts can be made compatible with an underlying tensor product structure by defining families of CGP measures that are additive.},

This transport is an ingredient of several perspective quantum devices including atomic chips. Here we examine coherent transport of ultra-cold atoms in a rocking quantum ratchet. This is realized by loading a rubidium atomic Bose–Einstein condensate into a periodic optical potential subjected to a biharmonic temporal drive. The achieved long-time coherence allows us to resolve resonance enhancement of the atom transport induced by avoided crossings in the Floquet spectrum of the system. By tuning the strength of the temporal modulations, we observe a bifurcation of a single resonance into a doublet. Our measurements reveal the role of interactions among Floquet eigenstates for quantum ratchet transport.},

abstract = {Quantum simulators are controllable quantum systems that can be used to mimic other quantum systems. They have the potential to enable the tackling of problems that are intractable on conventional computers. The photonic quantum technology available today is reaching the stage where significant advantages arise for the simulation of interesting problems in quantum chemistry, quantum biology and solid-state physics. In addition, photonic quantum systems also offer the unique benefit of being mobile over free space and in waveguide structures, which opens new perspectives to the field by enabling the natural investigation of quantum transport phenomena. Here, we review recent progress in the field of photonic quantum simulation, which should break the ground towards the realization of versatile quantum simulators. A bout 2,000 years ago, the Greeks built orreries, mechanical devices constructed to simulate the classical dynamics of planetary motion. The construction of orreries was made possible by technological advances in mechanics and materials science. One of the present directions in quantum science is the development of modern quantum orreries (Box 1), that is, quantum-mechanical simulators of chemical and physical processes at the scale where quantum effects are crucial. It was Richard Feynman who proposed the innovative idea for the efficient simulation of quantum systems: one could employ a controllable quantum system, he suggested, to reproduce the dynamics and the quantum state of the original system of study. Classical computers are unable to simulate quantum systems efficiently, because they need to enumerate quantum states one at a time. Quantum simulators allow us to bypass the exponential barriers imposed by entanglement and the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, which prevent classical computers from solving such problems efficiently. Thirty years after Feynman's original proposal 1 , quantum simulators of physical systems are being successfully constructed using a variety of quantum architectures, such as atoms 2–6 , trapped ions 7–13 , nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 14,15 and superconducting circuits 16,17 , as well as single photons 18–25 , which are the focus of this Review. However, even though there are many recent exciting developments in various quantum architectures, such as ion-trap quantum computing 9,11 , no physical implementation seems to have a definite edge in all aspects of the race at this point.

We present the working principle of such a basic unit, engineered using molecular chemistry, whose collective control and readout are executed using a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The basic unit we investigate is a synthetic polyproline with electron spins localized on attached molecular side groups separated by a few nanometers. We demonstrate the collective readout and coherent manipulation of very few (≤ 6) of these S = 1/2 electronic spin systems and access their direct dipolar coupling tensor. Our results show that it is feasible to use spin-labeled peptides as a resource for a molecular qubit–based network, while at the same time providing simple optical readout of single quantum states through NV magnetometry.

@article{Gour2015a,
abstract = {We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies, and that of quantifying the gap between the nonuniformity one must expend to achieve a single-shot state preparation or state conversion and the nonuniformity one can extract in the reverse operation. Quantum state-conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.},

By casting time-asymmetry as a quantifiable, fundamental resource of a quantum state we arrive at an additional, independent set of thermodynamic constraints that naturally extend the existing ones. These asymmetry relations reveal that the traditional Szilard engine argument does not extend automatically to quantum coherences, but instead only relational coherences in a multipartite scenario can contribute to thermodynamic work. We find that coherence transformations are always irreversible. Our results also reveal additional structural parallels between thermodynamics and the theory of entanglement.},

We introduce a new quantity called price, which characterizes the support of a protected logical system, and find constraints on the price and the distance for logical subalgebras of quantum codes. We show that holographic codes defined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically negative curvature exhibit uberholog-raphy, meaning that a bulk logical algebra can be supported on a boundary region with a fractal structure. We argue that, for holographic codes defined on bulk manifolds with asymptotically flat or positive curvature, the boundary physics must be highly nonlocal, an observation with potential implications for black holes and for quantum gravity in AdS space at distance scales that are small compared to the AdS curvature radius.},

When N is large, and both ¯ h and the quantum energy uncertainty E are small, quantum chaos theory can be used to demonstrate the following results: (i) given a generic observable A, the infinite time average A of the quantum expectation value A(t) is independent of all aspects of the initial state other than the total energy, and equal to an appropriate thermal average of A; (ii) the time variations of A(t)−A are too small to represent thermal fluctuations; (iii) however, the time variations of A 2 (t) − −A(t) 2 can be consistently interpreted as thermal fluctuations, even though these same time variations would be called quantum fluctuations when N is small. In this letter we examine the compatibility of certain results in quantum chaos theory with standard results in statistical mechanics. We consider a bounded, isolated, many-body quantum system whose classical limit is chaotic. Given an initial state |$\psi$(0) and a generic observable A, we ask the following questions. What is the infinite time average of A(t) ≡ ≡$\psi$(t)|A|$\psi$(t)? Is it independent of the initial state |$\psi$(0)? If so, is it equal to an appropriate thermal average of A? What are the root-mean-square fluctuations, in time, of A(t) about its infinite time average? Are these fluctuations correctly predicted by statistical mechanics? We begin by noting that the energy spectrum of a bounded quantum system is purely discrete; if the system is classically chaotic, and also has no discrete symmetries, then the energy eigenvalues E $\alpha$ are almost always non-degenerate [1].

abstract = {The Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory describes the formation of electron pairs, or Cooper pairs, and their instant condensation into a superconducting state. Helium atoms are 'preformed' bosons and, in addition to their superfluid state, can also form a quantum solid that lacks phase coherence. Here I show that the fate of Cooper pairs can be more varied than the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer or helium paradigms. In copper oxide d-wave superconductors, Cooper pairs are non-local objects, with both centre-of-mass and relative motions. As the level of doping of charge carriers decreases, the centre-of-mass fluctuations force a correlated d-wave superconductor into a state with enhanced diamagnetism and robust but short-ranged superconducting order. At extreme underdoping, the relative fluctuations take over and two pseudogaps—'small' (charge) and 'large' (spin)—emerge naturally, as Cooper pairs 'disintegrate' and charge detaches from spin-singlet bonds. The ensuing ground state(s) are governed by antiferromagnetic rather than by superconducting correlations.},

abstract = {We use the out-of-time-order (OTO) correlators to study the slow dynamics in the many-body localized (MBL) phase. We investigate OTO correlators in the effective ("l-bit") model of the MBL phase, and show that their amplitudes after disorder averaging approach their long-time limits as power-laws of time. This power-law dynamics is due to dephasing caused by interactions between the localized operators that fall off exponentially with distance. The long-time limits of the OTO correlators are determined by the overlaps of the local operators with the conserved l-bits. We demonstrate numerically our results in the effective model and three other more "realistic" spin chain models. Furthermore, we extend our calculations to the thermal phase and find that for a time-independent Hamiltonian, the OTO correlators also appear to vanish as a power law at long time, perhaps due to coupling to conserved densities. In contrast, we find that in the thermal phase of a Floquet spin model with no conserved densities the OTO correlator decays exponentially at long times.},

@article{Kinoshita,
abstract = {It is a fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics that a closed system with many degrees of freedom ergodically samples all equal energy points in phase space. To understand the limits of this assumption, it is important to find and study systems that are not ergodic, and thus do not reach thermal equilibrium. A few complex systems have been proposed that are expected not to thermalize because their dynamics are integrable 1,2 . Some nearly integrable systems of many particles have been studied numeri-cally, and shown not to ergodically sample phase space 3 . However, there has been no experimental demonstration of such a system with many degrees of freedom that does not approach thermal equilibrium. Here we report the preparation of out-of-equili-brium arrays of trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases, each containing from 40 to 250 87 Rb atoms, which do not noticeably equilibrate even after thousands of collisions. Our results are probably explainable by the well-known fact that a homogeneous 1D Bose gas with point-like collisional interactions is integrable. Until now, however, the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium 1D Bose gases has been a theoretically unsettled issue 4–6 , as practical factors such as harmonic trapping and imperfectly point-like interactions may compromise integrability. The absence of damp-ing in 1D Bose gases may lead to potential applications in force sensing and atom interferometry. To see qualitatively why 1D gases might not thermalize, consider the elastic collision of two isolated, identical mass classical particles in one dimension. Energy and momentum are conserved only if they simply exchange momenta. Clearly, the momentum distribution of a 1D ensemble of particles will not be altered by such pairwise collisions. The well-known behaviour of Newton's cradle (see Fig. 1a) is most easily understood in this way. Even when several balls are simultaneously in contact, particles in an idealized Newton's cradle just exchange specific momentum values, though the expla-nation is more subtle 7 . Generalization of the Newton's cradle to quantum mechanical particles lends it a ghostly air. Rather than just reflecting off each other, colliding particles can also transmit through each other. When the particles are identical, the final states after transmission and reflection are indistinguishable. In general, correlations and overlap among 1D Bose gas wavefunc-tions complicate the picture of independent particles colliding as in a Newton's cradle. In fact, there are circumstances in which 1D momentum distributions are known to change in time. For example, when weakly coupled bosons are released from a trap, the conversion of mean field energy to kinetic energy changes the momentum distribution. In the Tonks–Girardeau limit of infinite strength interactions 8 , although the 1D bosons interact locally like non-interacting fermions, their momentum distribution is not fermio-nic 9,10 . When a Tonks–Girardeau gas is released from a trap and expands in one dimension, its momentum distribution evolves into that of a trapped Fermi gas 11–13 . The quantum Newton's cradle view of particles colliding with each other and either reflecting or transmitting can only be applied when the kinetic energy of the collision greatly exceeds the energy per atom at zero temperature at the prevailing density 14 . The collisions that we study satisfy this criterion well. Our observations extend from the Tonks–Girardeau regime, where only pairwise collisions can occur 15 , to the intermediate coupling regime, where there can be three-(or more) body col-lisions 15–17 . In both regimes, atoms that are set oscillating and colliding in a trap do not appreciably thermalize during our experiment. We start our experiments with a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into the combination of a blue-detuned two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice and a red-detuned crossed dipole trap (see Methods). The combination of light traps makes a 2D array of distinct, parallel Bose gases, with the 2D lattice providing tight transverse confinement and the crossed dipole trap providing weak axial trap-ping 11},

@article{Modi2012,
abstract = {One of the best signatures of nonclassicality in a quantum system is the existence of correlations that have no classical counterpart. Different methods for quantifying the quantum and classical parts of correlations are amongst the more actively-studied topics of quantum information theory over the past decade. Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many cases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing quantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between the quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states. Here we review different notions of classical and quantum correlations quantified by quantum discord and other related measures. In the first half, we review the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations, relate them to each other, and discuss the classical-quantum division that is common among them. In the second half, we show that the measures identify and quantify the deviation from classicality in various quantum-information-processing tasks, quantum thermodynamics, open-system dynamics, and many-body physics. We show that in many cases quantum correlations indicate an advantage of quantum methods over classical ones.},

abstract = {We discuss the definition of quantum probability in the context of "timeless" general--relativistic quantum mechanics. In particular, we study the probability of sequences of events, or multi-event probability. In conventional quantum mechanics this can be obtained by means of the ``wave function collapse" algorithm. We first point out certain difficulties of some natural definitions of multi-event probability, including the conditional probability widely considered in the literature. We then observe that multi-event probability can be reduced to single-event probability, by taking into account the quantum nature of the measuring apparatus. In fact, by exploiting the von-Neumann freedom of moving the quantum classical boundary, one can always trade a sequence of non-commuting quantum measurements at different times, with an ensemble of simultaneous commuting measurements on the joint system+apparatus system. This observation permits a formulation of quantum theory based only on single-event probability, where the results of the "wave function collapse" algorithm can nevertheless be recovered. The discussion bears also on the nature of the quantum collapse.},

Using out-of-time-order correlation functions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to process quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators implies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information with almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the negativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic of scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely related to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results with numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect tensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the butterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic definition of scrambling.},

@book{Strocchi2008a,
abstract = {2nd ed. "The second printing contains a critical discussion of Dirac derivation of canonical quantization, which is instead deduced from general geometric structures. This book arises out of the need for Quantum Mechanics (QM) to be part of the common education of mathematics students. The mathematical structure of QM is formulated in terms of the C*-algebra of observables, which is argued on the basis of the operational definition of measurements and the duality between states and observables, for a general physical system. The Dirac–von Neumann axioms are then derived. The description of states and observables as Hilbert space vectors and operators follows from the GNS and Gelfand–Naimark Theorems. The experimental existence of complementary observables for atomic systems is shown to imply the noncommutativity of the observable algebra, the distinctive feature of QM; for finite degrees of freedom, the Weyl algebra codifies the experimental complementarity of position and momentum (Heisenberg commutation relations) and Schr{\"{o}}dinger QM follows from the von Neumann uniqueness theorem. The existence problem of the dynamics is related to the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian and solved by the Kato–Rellich conditions on the potential, which also guarantee quantum stability for classically unbounded-below Hamiltonians. Examples are discussed which include the explanation of the discreteness of the atomic spectra. Because of the increasing interest in the relation between QM and stochastic processes, a final chapter is devoted to the functional integral approach (Feynman–Kac formula), to the formulation in terms of ground state correlations (the quantum mechanical analog of the Wightman functions) and their analytic continuation to imaginary time (Euclidean QM). The quantum particle on a circle is discussed in detail, as an example of the interplay between topology and functional integral, leading to the emergence of superselection rules and $\theta$ sectors."--Publisher's description.

@article{Rakovszky2018,
abstract = {The scrambling of quantum information in closed many-body systems, as measured by out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs), has received considerable attention lately. Recently, a hydrody-namical description of OTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits. Numerical work suggests that aspects of this description are universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without randomness; a conjectured explanation for this is that while the random circuits have noise built into them, deterministic quantum systems, much like classically chaotic ones, "generate their own noise" and look effectively random on sufficient length scales and timescales. In this paper, we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved quantities (e.g., energy). We do this by considering local random unitary circuits with a conserved U(1) charge and argue, with numerical and analytical evidence, that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation in both time-ordered and out-of-time-ordered correlation functions; both can have a diffusively relaxing component or "hydrodynamic tail" at late times. We verify the presence of such tails also in a deterministic, periodically driven system. We show that for OTOCs, the combination of diffusive and ballistic components leads to a wave front with a specific asymmetric shape, decaying as a power law behind the front. These results also explain existing numerical investigations in non-noisy ergodic systems with energy conservation. Moreover, we consider OTOCs in Gibbs states, parametrized by a chemical potential $\mu$, and apply perturbative arguments to show that for $\mu$ ≫ 1 the ballistic front of information spreading can only develop at times exponentially large in $\mu$-with the information traveling diffusively at earlier times. We also develop a new formalism for describing OTOCs and operator spreading, which allows us to interpret the saturation of OTOCs as a form of thermalization on the Hilbert space of operators.},

abstract = {Evidence for the applicability of random-matrix theory to nuclear spectra is reviewed. In analogy to systems with few degrees of freedom, one speaks of chaos more accurately, quantum chaos in nuclei whenever random-matrix predictions are fulfilled. An introduction into the basic concepts of random-matrix theory is followed by a survey over the extant experimental information on spectral fluctuations, including a discussion of the violation of a symmetry or invariance property. Chaos in nuclear models is discussed for the spherical shell model, for the deformed shell model, and for the interacting boson model. Evidence for chaos also comes from random-matrix ensembles patterned after the shell model such as the embedded two-body ensemble, the two-body random ensemble, and the constrained ensembles. All this evidence points to the fact that chaos is a generic property of nuclear spectra, except for the ground-state regions of strongly deformed nuclei.},

abstract = {The ideas of thermodynamics have proved fruitful in the setting of quantum information theory, in particular the notion that when the allowed transformations of a system are restricted, certain states of the system become useful resources with which one can prepare previously inaccessible states. The theory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood resource theory in this sense. Here, we return to the basic questions of thermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum information theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges naturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations. Specifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be extracted from asymptotically many copies of a quantum system when using only reversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed temperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states can be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear amount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation analogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for entanglement dilution. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.250404 PACS numbers: 05.30.{\`{A}}d, 03.67.Bg, 03.67.Mn, 05.70.{\`{A}}a Quantum resource theories are specified by a restriction on the quantum operations (state preparations, measure-ments, and transformations) that can be implemented by one or more parties. This singles out a set of states which can be prepared under the restricted operations. If the parties facing the restriction acquire a quantum state out-side the restricted set of states, then they can use this state to implement measurements and transformations that are outside the class of allowed operations, consuming the state in the process. Thus, such states are useful resources. A few prominent examples serve to illustrate the idea: if two or more parties are restricted to communicating clas-sically and implementing local quantum operations, then entangled states become a resource [1]; if a party is re-stricted to quantum operations that have a particular sym-metry, then states that break this symmetry become a resource [2–4]; if a party is restricted to preparing states that are completely mixed and performing unitary opera-tions, then any state that is not completely mixed, i.e., any state that has some purity, becomes a resource [5]. In this Letter, we develop the quantum resource theory of states that are T athermal, i.e., not thermal at temperature T. This provides a useful new formulation of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for finite-dimensional quantum systems, and allows us to apply new mathematical tools to the subject. The restricted class of operations which defines our resource theory includes only those that can be achieved through energy-conserving unitaries and the preparation of any ancillary system in a thermal state at temperature T, as first studied by Janzing et al. [6] in the context of Landauer's principle. Here, the ancillary systems can have an arbitrary Hilbert space and an arbitrary Hamiltonian, and may be described as having access to a single heat bath at temperature T. States that are not in thermal equilibrium at temperature T are the resource in this approach. Quantum resource theories provide answers to questions such as: How does one measure the quality of different resource states? Can one particular resource state be con-verted to another deterministically? If not, can it be done nondeterministically, and if so with what probability? What if one has access to a catalyst? A particularly funda-mental problem, addressed in this Letter, is to identify the equivalence classes of states that are reversibly intercon-vertible in the limit of asymptotically many copies of the resource and to determine the rates of interconversion. We show that all T-athermal states are reversibly interconver-tible asymptotically and that the interconversion rate is governed by the free energies of the states involved. The great merit of the resource theory approach is its generality. Rather than considering the behavior of the property of interest for some particular system with},

abstract = {A debate has appeared in the literature on loop quantum gravity and spin foams, over whether the secondary simplicity constraints, reducing the connection to be Levi-Civita, should imply the shape matching conditions, reducing twisted geometries to Regge geometries. We address the question using a simple model with a flat dynamics, in which secondary simplicity constraints arise from a dynamical preservation of the primary ones. We find that shape matching conditions arise, thus providing support to an affirmative question. The origin of these extra conditions is to be found in the different graph localisation of the Hamiltonian and primary simplicity constraints. Our results are consistent with previous claims by Dittrich and Ryan, and extend their validity to Lorentzian signature and arbitrary cellular decompositions. We show in particular how the (gauge-invariant version of the) twist angle xi featuring in twisted geometries equals on-shell the Regge dihedral angle multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, thus recovering the discrete extrinsic geometry from the Ashtekar-Barbero holonomy. Finally, we confirm that flatness implies both the Levi-Civita and the shape-matching conditions using twisted geometries and a 4-dimensional version of the vertex condition appearing in 't Hooft's polygon model.},

More specifically, we show that there exists a set of roughly d log d unitary operators whose average effect on every input pure state is almost perfectly ran-domizing, as compared to the d 2 operators required to randomize perfectly. Aside from the private quantum channel, variations of this construction can be applied to many other tasks in quantum information processing. We show, for instance, that it can be used to construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more efficient than any others known, allowing roughly log d qubits to be hidden in 2 log d qubits. The method can also be used to exhibit the existence of quantum states with locked classical correlations, an arbitrarily large amplification of the correlation being accomplished by sending a negligibly small classical key. Our construction also provides the basic build-ing block for a method of remotely preparing arbitrary d-dimensional pure quantum states using approximately log d bits of communication and log d ebits of entanglement.},

abstract = {We derive a microscopic expression for the instantaneous diagonal elements of the density matrix nn ðtÞ in the adiabatic basis for an arbitrary time-dependent process in a closed Hamiltonian system. If the initial density matrix is stationary (diagonal) then this expression contains only squares of absolute values of matrix elements of the evolution operator, which can be interpreted as transition probabilities. We then derive the microscopic expression for the heat defined as the energy generated due to transitions between instantaneous energy levels. If the initial density matrix is passive [diagonal with nn ð0Þ monotonically decreasing with energy] then the heat is non-negative in agreement with basic expectations of thermo-dynamics. Our findings also can be used for systematic expansion of various observables around the adiabatic limit. The standard definition of heat is the energy transferred from one body to another due to a temperature difference. However, from everyday experience we know that we can generate heat not only by transferring energy from, say, hot to cold objects but by doing some mechanical work. For example, if we take a container with a gas isolated from the environment and then perform some cyclic process over this gas [1], e.g., compress and decompress it, then we will generate the heat unless we do it very slowly (adiabati-cally). In quantum mechanics for a cyclic process the heat will be equal to the energy increase caused by the transi-tions between different energy levels and thus it can be microscopically defined even for an isolated system. If two systems are brought into contact for a certain time and then again separated then heat can be defined in a similar fashion: energy change of a system due to transitions between different energy levels. On the other hand, by work in thermodynamics one usually understands the re-versible part of the energy change, which is due to the change in the energy level structure but not due to the transitions. In a closed system then the total energy at each moment of time is E ðtÞ ¼ X},

abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate the fluctuation theorem, which predicts appreciable and measurable violations of the second law of thermodynamics for small systems over short time scales, by following the trajectory of a colloidal particle captured in an optical trap that is translated relative to surrounding water molecules. From each particle trajectory, we calculate the entropy production/consumption over the duration of the trajectory and determine the fraction of second law-defying trajectories. Our results show entropy consumption can occur over colloidal length and time scales. Inventors and engineers endeavor to scale down machines and engines to nanometer sizes for a wide range of technological purposes. However, there is a fundamental limitation to miniaturization as small engines are not simple rescaled versions of their larger counterparts. If the work performed during the duty cycle of any machine is comparable to thermal energy per degree of freedom, then one can expect that the machine will operate in ''reverse'' over short time scales. That is, heat energy from the surroundings will be converted into useful work allowing the engine to run backwards. For larger engines, we would describe this as a violation of the second law of thermodynamics, as entropy is consumed rather than generated. This has received little attention in the nanotech-nology literature, as there was no quantitative description of the probability of entropy consumption in such small engines. The only thermodynamic statement available was the second law itself, stating that, for large systems and over long times, the entropy production rate is necessarily positive. Even the foundations of statistical mechanics were unsettled as thermodynamicists questioned how the second law of thermodynamics could be reconciled with reversible microscopic equations of motion. Loschmidt's paradox states that in a time reversible system, for every phase-space trajectory there exists a time-reversed antitra-jectory [1]. As the entropy production of a trajectory and its conjugate antitrajectory are of identical magnitude but opposite sign, then, so the argument goes, one cannot prove that entropy production is positive. However, in 1993, a resolution and quantitative description of violations of the second law in finite systems was given by the fluctuation theorem (FT) of Evans et al. [2]. The theorem provides an analytic expression for the probability that the dissipative flux flows in the direction reverse to that required by the second law of thermo-dynamics. In other words, the theorem predicts appreciable and measureable violations of the second law for small systems over short time scales. Specifically, the theorem relates the probability, Pr, of observing a phase-space trajectory of duration t with entropy production t  A, to that of a trajectory with the same magnitude of entropy change, but where the entropy is consumed or absorbed: Pr t  A Pr t  {\"{y}}A  expA : (1) As the entropy production, t , is an extensive property, its magnitude scales with system size and observation time or trajectory duration t. Thus, the FT also shows that as the system size gets larger or the trajectory duration becomes longer, entropy-consuming trajectories become unlikely, and we recover the expected second law behavior. Much of the work done in developing and extending the theorem was accomplished by theoreticians [3-6] and mathematicians [7,8] interested in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [9-11]. A few demonstrations of the theorem have been provided with computer simulations [3,12-14]. However, there has been no practical experimental demonstration of the predictions of the theorem. A pedagogical review of the FT was published recently [15]. In this Letter, we demonstrate and quantitatively confirm the predictions of the FT for transient systems [3] by experimentally following the trajectory of a colloidal particle in an optical trap. An optical trap is formed when the micron-sized transparent particle whose index of refraction is greater than the surrounding medium, is located within a focused laser beam. The refracted rays differ in intensity over the volume of the sphere and exert a pico-Newton scale force (pN  10 {\"{y}}12 N) on the particle, drawing it towards the region of highest light intensity [16]. The optical trap is harmonic near the focal point: the force acting on a colloidal particle positioned at x within a trap centered at x 0 is F opt  {\"{y}}kx {\"{y}} x 0 , where k is the trapping constant which can be tuned by adjusting the laser power. In our experiment, the optical trap translates relative to the solvent at a velocity v opt , starting from time t  0.

abstract = {Motivated by recent experiments, we study the relaxation dynamics and thermalization in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model induced by a global interaction quench. Specifically, we start from an initial state that has exactly one boson per site and is the ground state of a system with infinitely strong repulsive interactions at unit filling. Using exact diagonalization and the density-matrix renormalization-group method, we compute the time dependence of such observables as the multiple occupancy and the momentum distribution function. Typically, the relaxation to stationary values occurs over just a few tunneling times. The stationary values are identical to the so-called diagonal ensemble on the system sizes accessible to our numerical methods and we further observe that the microcanonical ensemble describes the time averages of many observables reasonably well for small and intermediate interaction strength. The expectation values of observables in the canonical ensemble agree quantitatively with the time averages obtained from the quench at small interaction strengths, and qualitatively provide a good description even in parameter regimes where the microcanonical ensemble is not applicable due to finite-size effects. We discuss our numerical results in the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, we also observe that the diagonal and the canonical ensembles are practically identical for our initial conditions already on the level of their respective energy distributions for small interaction strengths. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for the interpretation of a recent sudden expansion experiment [Phys. Rev.

abstract = {Colored tensor models have recently burst onto the scene as a promising con-ceptual and computational tool in the investigation of problems of random geometry in dimension three and higher. We present a snapshot of the cutting edge in this rapidly expanding research field. Colored tensor models have been shown to share many of the properties of their direct ancestor, matrix models, which encode a theory of fluctuating two-dimensional surfaces. These features include the possession of Feynman graphs encoding topological spaces, a 1/N expansion of graph amplitudes, embedded matrix models inside the tensor structure, a resumable leading order with critical behavior and a continuum large volume limit, Schwinger–Dyson equations satisfying a Lie algebra (akin to the Virasoro al-gebra in two dimensions), non-trivial classical solutions and so on. In this review, we give a detailed introduction of colored tensor models and pointers to current and future research directions.},

This implies an extension of the zeroth law of thermodynamics to nonequilibrium states and it leads to the identification of a unique distribution/1 describing the asymptotic properties of the time evolution of the system for initial data randomly chosen with respect to a uniform distribution on phase space. For conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution/.t: it leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a nontrivial, parameter-free, way by a recent computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium. Similar applications to other models are proposed, in particular to a model for the Kolmogorov-Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.},

@article{Pertot2014,
abstract = {This Letter comprises an experimental and theoretical investigation of the time evolution of a Fermi gas following fast and slow quenches of a one-dimensional optical double-well superlattice potential. We investigate both the local tunneling in the connected double wells and the global dynamics towards a steady state, i.e., a time-independent state. The local observables in the steady state resemble those of a thermal equilibrium state, whereas the global properties indicate a strong nonequilibrium situation. One of the grand goals of physics is the dynamic control of quantum matter. Inducing controlled changes between quantum states, both rapid and slow, has important appli-cations in quantum computing, quantum devices, and the dynamic control of materials as, for example, ultrafast demagnetization and magnetization control. The demand for the dynamic control of quantum matter raises many fundamental questions on the understanding of nonequili-brium quantum processes. Recently, the dynamic behavior of a system as a response to so-called quantum quenches, sudden or slow parameter changes, has attracted particular interest. Part of the increased interest stems from the experimental progress in the area of atomic quantum gases, which are excellent systems to study quantum dynamics [1,2]. This is due to the clean preparation, wide tunability, and long coherence times. In particular, different dynamical proc-esses can be well separated and time scales for the real-time detection are experimentally favorable. The fastest relevant energy scale, the Fermi energy, is on the order of 10 kHz and can be well resolved. So far, experimental progress in probing and understanding dynamical phenomena in opti-cal lattices has been mostly focused on bosonic systems where, for example, interaction quenches have been studied [3–12]. With fermionic gases in optical lattices, interaction quenches [13–16] and spin dynamics have been inves-tigated [17,18]. In this Letter we investigate experimentally and theo-retically the time evolution of a Fermi gas in a bichromatic optical lattice which is imposed along one dimension of the gas, following a sudden or a slow quench of the lattice potential. We initially prepare a patterned density distribu-tion and measure the relaxation of both local and nonlocal observables towards a steady state. Experimentally [19], we start from a noninteracting degenerate gas of N ¼ 1.2ð2Þ × 10 5 40 K atoms in two spin states in a dipole trap with trapping frequencies $\omega$ x ¼ 2$\pi$ × 38 Hz, $\omega$ y ¼ 2$\pi$ × 66 Hz, and $\omega$ z ¼ 2$\pi$ × 376 Hz. The scattering length between the two components is set to zero by means of a Feshbach resonance. The gas has a temperature of ð0.3 AE 0.1ÞT F where k B T F ¼ E F is the Fermi energy. We then apply a bichromatic optical lattice along the x axis which consists of a short-period (" green ") lattice of wavelength $\lambda$ G ¼ 532 nm and a long-period (" red ") lattice of wavelength $\lambda$ R ¼ 1064 nm [20]. The bichromatic lattice potential at the location of the atoms is given by VðxÞ ¼ V G cos 2 ðk G x − ϕÞ − V R cos 2 ðk R xÞ, where V G (V R) is the potential depth of the green (red) lattice and k R=G ¼ 2$\pi$=$\lambda$ R=G . The periods of the two lattices differ by a factor of 2, up to a small, controlled and adjustable difference. This difference results in the relative phase ϕ and permits the generation of distinct double-well configurations [5]. We use this control over the lattice potential for a density-patterned loading of the atomic ensemble and for the subsequent discrimination of the density in even and odd wells during measurement [4,5,21]. The ramp sequence for the optical lattice potentials and the resulting lowest eigenenergies of the central double wells are sketched in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The Fermi gas is initially loaded into the red lattice by ramping up the depth to V R ¼ 48E rec;R in 50 ms, where E rec;R=G ¼ ℏ},

abstract = {We validate experimentally a fluctuation relation known as generalized Jarzynski equality governing the work distribution in a feedback-controlled system. The feedback control is performed on a single electron box analogously to the original Szilard engine. In the generalized Jarzynski equality, mutual information is treated on an equal footing with the thermodynamic work. Our measurements provide the first evidence of the role of mutual information in the fluctuation theorem and thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The second law of thermodynamics gives the inevitable upper bound of the available work that we can extract from fuels and heat baths. Information has been recognized as another kind of thermodynamic fuel that can be used to extract work with measurement and feedback control. The relation between information and thermodynamics is a topic of long-standing interest in the field of statistical physics, dating back to the thought experiment of a "Maxwell demon" [1-3]. Relatively recent progress with universal nonequilibrium equalities applying to irreversible processes, known as fluctuation theorems [4-11], has brought renewed attention to this problem. In particular, the second law of thermodynamics and nonequilibrium equalities have been generalized to irreversible processes that involve information treatment, such as measurement, feedback control, or information erasure [12-23]. A Maxwell demon is an object that measures the microscopic state of a system and drives it to extract work or store energy with the aid of the measurement outcome. A crucial element for the fidelity of this operation is mutual information hIi. It characterizes the correlation between the state of the measured thermodynamic system and the measurement outcome stored into the memory of the measurement device, and as such describes the efficiency of the measurement. Several recent experiments have illustrated the relation between information and thermo-dynamics [24-27]; however, none have yet demonstrated the role of mutual information in irreversible feedback processes. In this Letter, we study experimentally the mutual information in a feedback-controlled device and provide the first demonstration of its connection to the fluctuation theorem. When the state of a generic thermodynamic system in state n is measured with an outcome m, the stochastic mutual information [17,22] is defined as Iðm; nÞ≔ ln PðnjmÞ − ln PðnÞ; ð1Þ where PðnÞ is the initial probability of the state being n, whereas PðnjmÞ is the probability that it is n under the condition that the measurement outcome is m. As Iðm; nÞ depends on the probability distribution of ðm; nÞ, we need to measure many samples in the ensemble in order to determine the value of Iðm; nÞ, as is the case for stochastic Shannon entropy [28]. Jarzynski equality (JE) [5], he −ðW−$\Delta$FÞ=k B T i ¼ 1; ð2Þ has been generalized to systems with measurement and feedback control [17] to he −ðW−$\Delta$FÞ=k B T−I i ¼ 1; ð3Þ where W is the applied work, $\Delta$F is the change in free energy, T is the temperature of the thermal reservoir, and k B is the Boltzmann constant. Equation (3) further reproduces the second law of thermodynamics as hWi − $\Delta$F ≥ −k B ThIi; ð4Þ where mutual information [29] hIi is the expectation value of the stochastic mutual information. As hIi is maximized in the ideal limit of the measurement correlating perfectly with the actual state, i.e., PðnjmÞ ¼ $\delta$ mn , the magnitude of hIi describes the efficiency of the measurement, providing the upper limit to how much work can be extracted from the system for the given information. We further define $\eta$ f ≔ −ðhWi − $\Delta$FÞ k B ThIi ≤ 1 ð5Þ to describe the efficiency of the feedback control. If $\eta$ f ¼ 1, the feedback control is perfect and thermodynamically reversible, where all of the mutual information is extracted as work. The condition to achieve the reversible feedback has been discussed in Ref. [20].},

abstract = {Typical elements of quantum networks are made by identical systems, which are the basic particles constituting a resource for quantum information processing. Whether the indistinguishability due to particle identity is an exploitable quantum resource remains an open issue. Here we study independently prepared identical particles showing that, when they spatially overlap, an operational entanglement exists that can be made manifest by means of separated localized measurements. We prove this entanglement is physical in that it can be directly exploited to activate quantum information protocols, such as teleportation. These results establish that particle indistinguishability is a utilizable quantum feature and open the way to new quantum-enhanced applications. The discovery and exploitation of suitable resources is one of the main aims in quantum information and compu-tation processing [1]. Quantum-enhanced technologies often employ identical systems (e.g., qubits, two-level atoms, photons, electrons, quasiparticles), which are bosons or fermions and constitute the elementary building blocks (particles) of quantum networks [2–7]. However, while for distinguishable particles an operational frame-work to exploit their properties is well established by individual operations on each particle [8], for identical particles, which are indistinguishable and individually unaddressable [9,10], the problem of their direct utilization remains open. This is a main issue for the development of quantum technology relying on identical particles. A fundamental feature of composite systems, at the core of quantum algorithms, quantum metrology, quantum key distribution, and teleportation [7,11–13], is entanglement.},

abstract = {An elegant but seldom appreciated effort to provide a mechanical model of equilibrium thermodynamics dates back to the Helmholtz theorem (HT). According to this theorem, the thermodynamic relations hold mechanically (without probabilistic assumptions) in the case of one-dimensional monocyclic systems. Thanks to a discrete picture of the phase space, Boltzmann was able to apply the HT to multi-dimensional ergodic systems, suggesting that the thermodynamic relations we observe in macroscopic systems at equilibrium are a direct consequence of the microscopic laws of dynamics alone. Here I review Boltzmann's argument and show that, using the language of the modern ergodic theory, it can be safely re-expressed on a continuum phase space as a generalized Helmholtz theorem(GHT), which can be readily proved. Along the way the agreement between the Helmholtz–Boltzmann theory and that of P. Hertz (based on adiabatic invariance) is revealed. Both theories, in fact, lead to define the entropy as the logarithm of the phase-space volume enclosed by the constant energy hyper-surface (volume entropy).},

abstract = {Atoms with highly excited electrons—called Rydberg atoms—have many exaggerated properties compared with ordinary ground-state atoms. For example, the loosely bound electrons create large dipoles that lead to long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms that are many orders of magnitude stronger than those between ground-state atoms. Strong interactions between Rydberg atoms can enable energy transport over distances many times the size of the atoms ( 1 ). On page 954 of this issue ( 2 ), G{\"{u}}nter et al. describe how they have nondestructively and continuously imaged resonant-energy transfer between cold 87Rb Rydberg atoms with controlled coupling to the environment. Their technique may enable the engineering of open quantum systems for quantum simulation ( 3 ), which could lend insight to the transition from classical to quantum energy transport in complex systems. The nature of this transition in a dissipative environment remains an open question and may have relevance to the efficiency of dipole-coupled energy transport in molecular systems such as photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes ( 4 ).},

Here we investigate work, heat and entropy production in bipartite systems characterized by particular commutators between their local Hamiltonians and the interaction operator. We consider the formalism of (Weimer et al 2008 Europhys. Lett. 83 30008), in which heat (work) is identified with energy changes that (do not) alter the local von Neumann entropy, as observed in an effective local measurement basis. We demonstrate the consequences of the commutation relations on the work and heat fluxes into each partition, and extend the formalism to open quantum systems where one, or both, partitions are subject to a Markovian thermal bath. We also discuss the relation between heat and entropy in bipartite quantum systems out of thermal equilibrium, and reconcile the aforementioned approach with the second law of thermodynamics.},

It signals the emergence of a conducting singlet state formed by a localized dot degree of freedom and conduction electrons. Carbon nanotubes offer the possibility to study the emergence of the Kondo entanglement by tuning many-body correlations with a gate voltage. Here we show another side of Kondo correlations, which counterintuitively tend to block conduction channels: inelastic co-tunnelling lines in the magnetospectrum of a carbon nanotube strikingly disappear when tuning the gate voltage. Considering the global SU(2) {\#} SU(2) symmetry of a nanotube coupled to leads, we find that only resonances involving flips of the Kramers pseudospins, associated to this symmetry, are observed at temperatures and voltages below the corresponding Kondo scale. Our results demonstrate the robust formation of entangled many-body states with no net pseudospin.},

abstract = {The Shannon entropy of a collection of random variables is subject to a number of constraints, the best-known examples being monotonicity and strong subadditivity. It remains an open question to decide which of these " laws of information theory " are also respected by the von Neumann entropy of many-body quantum states. In this article, we consider a toy version of this difficult problem by analyzing the von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states. We find that the von Neumann entropy of stabilizer states satisfies all balanced information inequalities that hold in the classical case. Our argument is built on the fact that stabilizer states have a classical model, provided by the discrete Wigner function: The phase-space entropy of the Wigner function corresponds directly to the von Neumann entropy of the state, which allows us to reduce to the classical case. Our result has a natural counterpart for multi-mode Gaussian states, which sheds some light on the general properties of the construction. We also discuss the relation of our results to recent work by Linden, Ruskai, and Winter [ " The quantum entropy cone of stabiliser states, " e-print arXiv:1302.5453]. C 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

In this paper we introduce the novel concept of entanglement susceptibility by expanding the 2-Renyi entropy in the boundary couplings. We show how this concept leads to the emergence of area laws for bi-partite quantum entanglement in systems ruled by local gapped Hamiltonians. Entanglement susceptibility also captures quantitatively which violations one should expect when the system becomes gapless. We also discuss an exact series expansion of the 2-Renyi entanglement entropy in terms of connected correlation functions of a boundary term.

@article{DePalma2015a,
abstract = {Under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), quantum-quenched systems equilibrate towards canonical, thermal ensembles. While at first glance the ETH might seem a very strong hypothesis, we show that it is indeed not only sufficient but also necessary for thermalization. More specifically, we consider systems coupled to baths with well-defined macroscopic temperature and show that whenever all product states thermalize then the ETH must hold. Our result definitively settles the question of determining whether a quantum system has a thermal behavior, reducing it to checking whether its Hamiltonian satisfies the ETH. An ideal heat bath induces thermalization in the sense that, when a physical system is coupled to it, its state will evolve into a well-defined infinite-time limit which depends only on macroscopic parameters of the bath—such as its temperature or energy—and not on any details of the initial state of the system, the bath, or the system-bath interaction. It is a well-established empirical fact that both classical and quantum systems with a very large number of degrees of freedom exhibit these ideal-bath properties when weakly coupled to much smaller systems, with their temperature being a smooth function of their energy alone. Yet, rigorous derivations relaying such a " generic " behavior to fundamental dynamical laws seem to require rather sophisticated, and arguably very specific and technical, hypotheses. Then, understanding the mechanisms lying behind the thermalization of a quantum system has become a hot-debated topic in physics. The apparent incongruence between the ubiquity of thermalization and the specificity of the hypotheses that seem to imply it has spurred substantial research [1–30], analyzing the dynamical con-ditions under which a large quantum system behaves as an ideal heat bath and induces thermalization. Prominent among them is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which may be formulated by stating that the partial traces of the eigenstates of the global Hamiltonian of the bath and the coupled system (including the interaction terms) are smooth functions of the energy. It is well known that the ETH is sufficient for thermal-ization if the initial state has a sufficiently sharp distribution in energy [1,19], and a lot of effort has been dedicated in checking whether specific quantum systems satisfy the ETH, with both analytical and numerical computations [9,12,26–30]. The converse question, however, of whether the ETH is also necessary for thermalization, i.e., whether there exist quantum systems not fulfilling the ETH but nonetheless exhibiting thermal behavior, is not settled yet, and alter-natives to the ETH have been proposed [13]. An answer to this question has been hinted at, although not proven, in the literature on the subject (see, e.g., the very recent survey [19], to which the reader is also referred for a comprehensive overview of the context). The goal of the present work is to clarify this subtle and somewhat elusive point by providing, for the first time to our knowledge, a proof that the very definition of an ideal bath actually implies the ETH. Our result then definitively settles the question of determining whether a quantum system has a thermal behavior, reducing it to checking whether its Hamiltonian satisfies the ETH: if the ETH is satisfied, the system always thermalizes, while if it is not satisfied, there certainly exists some reasonable physical initial state not leading to thermalization. Before starting with the actual proof, we find it man-datory to state preliminary, rigorous definitions of thermal-ization, of an ideal bath, and of the ETH itself. We will then reconsider the role of the ETH as a sufficient condition for thermalization on the basis of our definitions, and then proceed to present of our main finding, that the ETH is also necessary for thermalization. Complete proofs of the lemmata needed in the Letter may be found in the Supplemental Material [31]. Thermalization and ideal baths.—Consider a system S coupled to a heat bath B, with Hilbert spaces H S and H B of dimension d S and d B , respectively. For convenience, we describe the total Hamiltonian a H H C H B , com-posed of a free ter H B associated with the bath's inner dynamics, and a ter H C that includes both the free component associated with S and the system-bath coupling component. We only require the norm H C ∥ to be bounded independently of the dimension d B of the bath [32]. Let},

abstract = {The relationship between thermodynamics and statistical physics is valid in the thermodynamic limit - when the number of particles becomes very large. Here, we study thermodynamics in the opposite regime - at both the nano scale, and when quantum effects become important. Applying results from quantum information theory we construct a theory of thermodynamics in these limits. We derive general criteria for thermodynamical state transformations, and as special cases, find two free energies: one that quantifies the deterministically extractable work from a small system in contact with a heat bath, and the other that quantifies the reverse process. We find that there are fundamental limitations on work extraction from nonequilibrium states, owing to finite size effects and quantum coherences. This implies that thermodynamical transitions are generically irreversible at this scale. As one application of these methods, we analyse the efficiency of small heat engines and find that they are irreversible during the adiabatic stages of the cycle.},
